            "CHAPTER IIf it had not rained on a certain May morning\nValancy Stirling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds whole life would have been entirely different. She would\nhave gone, with the rest of her clan, to Aunt Wellington\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds engagement picnic\nand Dr. Trent would have gone to Montreal. But it did rain and you shall hear\nwhat happened to her because of it.",
            "Valancy wakened early, in the lifeless, hopeless hour just preceding dawn. She\nhad not slept very well. One does not sleep well, sometimes, when one is\ntwenty-nine on the morrow, and unmarried, in a community and connection where\nthe unmarried are simply those who have failed to get a man.",
            "Deerwood and the Stirlings had long since relegated Valancy to hopeless old\nmaidenhood. But Valancy herself had never quite relinquished a certain pitiful,\nshamed, little hope that Romance would come her way yet\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnever, until this\nwet, horrible morning, when she wakened to the fact that she was twenty-nine\nand unsought by any man.",
            "Ay, there lay the sting. Valancy did not mind so much being an old maid.\nAfter all, she thought, being an old maid couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt possibly be as dreadful as\nbeing married to an Uncle Wellington or an Uncle Benjamin, or even an Uncle\nHerbert. What hurt her was that she had never had a chance to be anything but\nan old maid. No man had ever desired her.",
            "The tears came into her eyes as she lay there alone in the faintly greying\ndarkness. She dared not let herself cry as hard as she wanted to, for two\nreasons. She was afraid that crying might bring on another attack of that pain\naround the heart. She had had a spell of it after she had got into\nbed\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdrather worse than any she had had yet. And she was afraid her mother\nwould notice her red eyes at breakfast and keep at her with minute, persistent,\nmosquito-like questions regarding the cause thereof.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdSuppose,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd thought Valancy with a ghastly grin, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI answered with the plain\ntruth, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI am crying because I cannot get married.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd How horrified Mother would\nbe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthough she is ashamed every day of her life of her old maid daughter.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBut of course appearances should be kept up. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt is not,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Valancy could hear\nher mother\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds prim, dictatorial voice asserting, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdit is not maidenly to\nthink about men.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe thought of her mother\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds expression made Valancy laugh\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfor she had a\nsense of humour nobody in her clan suspected. For that matter, there were a\ngood many things about Valancy that nobody suspected. But her laughter was very\nsuperficial and presently she lay there, a huddled, futile little figure,\nlistening to the rain pouring down outside and watching, with a sick distaste,\nthe chill, merciless light creeping into her ugly, sordid room.",
            "She knew the ugliness of that room by heart\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdknew it and hated it. The\nyellow-painted floor, with one hideous, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhooked\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd rug by the bed, with a\ngrotesque, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhooked\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd dog on it, always grinning at her when she awoke; the\nfaded, dark-red paper; the ceiling discoloured by old leaks and crossed by\ncracks; the narrow, pinched little washstand; the brown-paper lambrequin with\npurple roses on it; the spotted old looking-glass with the crack across it,\npropped up on the inadequate dressing-table; the jar of ancient potpourri made\nby her mother in her mythical honeymoon; the shell-covered box, with one burst\ncorner, which Cousin Stickles had made in her equally mythical girlhood; the\nbeaded pincushion with half its bead fringe gone; the one stiff, yellow chair;\nthe faded old motto, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdGone but not forgotten,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd worked in coloured yarns about\nGreat-grand-mother Stirling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds grim old face; the old photographs of ancient\nrelatives long banished from the rooms below. There were only two pictures that\nwere not of relatives. One, an old chromo of a puppy sitting on a rainy\ndoorstep. That picture always made Valancy unhappy. That forlorn little dog\ncrouched on the doorstep in the driving rain! Why didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt some one open\nthe door and let him in? The other picture was a faded, passe-partouted\nengraving of Queen Louise coming down a stairway, which Aunt Wellington had\nlavishly given her on her tenth birthday. For nineteen years she had looked at\nit and hated it, beautiful, smug, self-satisfied Queen Louise. But she never\ndared destroy it or remove it. Mother and Cousin Stickles would have been\naghast, or, as Valancy irreverently expressed it in her thoughts, would have\nhad a fit.",
            "Every room in the house was ugly, of course. But downstairs appearances were\nkept up somewhat. There was no money for rooms nobody ever saw. Valancy\nsometimes felt that she could have done something for her room herself, even\nwithout money, if she were permitted. But her mother had negatived every timid\nsuggestion and Valancy did not persist. Valancy never persisted. She was afraid\nto. Her mother could not brook opposition. Mrs. Stirling would sulk for days if\noffended, with the airs of an insulted duchess.",
            "The only thing Valancy liked about her room was that she could be alone there\nat night to cry if she wanted to.",
            "But, after all, what did it matter if a room, which you used for nothing except\nsleeping and dressing in, were ugly? Valancy was never permitted to stay alone\nin her room for any other purpose. People who wanted to be alone, so Mrs.\nFrederick Stirling and Cousin Stickles believed, could only want to be alone\nfor some sinister purpose. But her room in the Blue Castle was everything a\nroom should be.",
            "Valancy, so cowed and subdued and overridden and snubbed in real life, was wont\nto let herself go rather splendidly in her day-dreams. Nobody in the Stirling\nclan, or its ramifications, suspected this, least of all her mother and Cousin\nStickles. They never knew that Valancy had two homes\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe ugly red brick\nbox of a home, on Elm Street, and the Blue Castle in Spain. Valancy had lived\nspiritually in the Blue Castle ever since she could remember. She had been a\nvery tiny child when she found herself possessed of it. Always, when she shut\nher eyes, she could see it plainly, with its turrets and banners on the\npine-clad mountain height, wrapped in its faint, blue loveliness, against the\nsunset skies of a fair and unknown land. Everything wonderful and beautiful was\nin that castle. Jewels that queens might have worn; robes of moonlight and\nfire; couches of roses and gold; long flights of shallow marble steps, with\ngreat, white urns, and with slender, mist-clad maidens going up and down them;\ncourts, marble-pillared, where shimmering fountains fell and nightingales sang\namong the myrtles; halls of mirrors that reflected only handsome knights and\nlovely women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdherself the loveliest of all, for whose glance men died. All\nthat supported her through the boredom of her days was the hope of going on a\ndream spree at night. Most, if not all, of the Stirlings would have died of\nhorror if they had known half the things Valancy did in her Blue Castle.",
            "For one thing she had quite a few lovers in it. Oh, only one at a time. One who\nwooed her with all the romantic ardour of the age of chivalry and won her after\nlong devotion and many deeds of derring-do, and was wedded to her with pomp and\ncircumstance in the great, banner-hung chapel of the Blue Castle.",
            "At twelve, this lover was a fair lad with golden curls and heavenly blue eyes.\nAt fifteen, he was tall and dark and pale, but still necessarily handsome. At\ntwenty, he was ascetic, dreamy, spiritual. At twenty-five, he had a clean-cut\njaw, slightly grim, and a face strong and rugged rather than handsome. Valancy\nnever grew older than twenty-five in her Blue Castle, but recently\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdvery\nrecently\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdher hero had had reddish, tawny hair, a twisted smile and a\nmysterious past.",
            "I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say Valancy deliberately murdered these lovers as she outgrew them. One\nsimply faded away as another came. Things are very convenient in this respect\nin Blue Castles.",
            "But, on this morning of her day of fate, Valancy could not find the key of her\nBlue Castle. Reality pressed on her too hardly, barking at her heels like a\nmaddening little dog. She was twenty-nine, lonely, undesired,\nill-favoured\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe only homely girl in a handsome clan, with no past and no\nfuture. As far as she could look back, life was drab and colourless, with not\none single crimson or purple spot anywhere. As far as she could look forward it\nseemed certain to be just the same until she was nothing but a solitary, little\nwithered leaf clinging to a wintry bough. The moment when a woman realises that\nshe has nothing to live for\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdneither love, duty, purpose nor\nhope\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdholds for her the bitterness of death.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAnd I just have to go on living because I can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt stop. I may have to live\neighty years,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd thought Valancy, in a kind of panic. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre all horribly\nlong-lived. It sickens me to think of it.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdShe was glad it was raining\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor rather, she was drearily satisfied that it\nwas raining. There would be no picnic that day. This annual picnic, whereby\nAunt and Uncle Wellington\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdone always thought of them in that\nsuccession\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdinevitably celebrated their engagement at a picnic thirty\nyears before, had been, of late years, a veritable nightmare to Valancy. By an\nimpish coincidence it was the same day as her birthday and, after she had\npassed twenty-five, nobody let her forget it.",
            "Much as she hated going to the picnic, it would never have occurred to her to\nrebel against it. There seemed to be nothing of the revolutionary in her\nnature. And she knew exactly what every one would say to her at the picnic.\nUncle Wellington, whom she disliked and despised even though he had fulfilled\nthe highest Stirling aspiration, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmarrying money,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd would say to her in a pig\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nwhisper, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNot thinking of getting married yet, my dear?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and then go off into\nthe bellow of laughter with which he invariably concluded his dull remarks.\nAunt Wellington, of whom Valancy stood in abject awe, would tell her about\nOlive\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds new chiffon dress and Cecil\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds last devoted letter. Valancy would have\nto look as pleased and interested as if the dress and letter had been hers or\nelse Aunt Wellington would be offended. And Valancy had long ago decided that\nshe would rather offend God than Aunt Wellington, because God might forgive her\nbut Aunt Wellington never would.",
            "Aunt Alberta, enormously fat, with an amiable habit of always referring to her\nhusband as \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhe,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd as if he were the only male creature in the world, who could\nnever forget that she had been a great beauty in her youth, would condole with\nValancy on her sallow skin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know why all the girls of today are so sunburned. When I was a\ngirl my skin was roses and cream. I was counted the prettiest girl in Canada,\nmy dear.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdPerhaps Uncle Herbert wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say anything\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor perhaps he would remark\njocularly, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHow fat you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre getting, Doss!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd And then everybody would laugh over\nthe excessively humorous idea of poor, scrawny little Doss getting fat.",
            "Handsome, solemn Uncle James, whom Valancy disliked but respected because he\nwas reputed to be very clever and was therefore the clan oracle\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbrains\nbeing none too plentiful in the Stirling connection\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwould probably remark\nwith the owl-like sarcasm that had won him his reputation, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI suppose you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre\nbusy with your hope-chest these days?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAnd Uncle Benjamin would ask some of his abominable conundrums, between wheezy\nchuckles, and answer them himself.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhat is the difference between Doss and a mouse?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe mouse wishes to harm the cheese and Doss wishes to charm the he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy had heard him ask that riddle fifty times and every time she wanted to\nthrow something at him. But she never did. In the first place, the Stirlings\nsimply did not throw things; in the second place, Uncle Benjamin was a wealthy\nand childless old widower and Valancy had been brought up in the fear and\nadmonition of his money. If she offended him he would cut her out of his\nwill\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsupposing she were in it. Valancy did not want to be cut out of\nUncle Benjamin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds will. She had been poor all her life and knew the galling\nbitterness of it. So she endured his riddles and even smiled tortured little\nsmiles over them.",
            "Aunt Isabel, downright and disagreeable as an east wind, would criticise her in\nsome way\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy could not predict just how, for Aunt Isabel never\nrepeated a criticism\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe found something new with which to jab you every\ntime. Aunt Isabel prided herself on saying what she thought, but didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt like it\nso well when other people said what they thought to her. Valancy\nnever said what she thought.",
            "Cousin Georgiana\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnamed after her great-great-grand-mother, who had been\nnamed after George the Fourth\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwould recount dolorously the names of all\nrelatives and friends who had died since the last picnic and wonder \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhich of\nus will be the first to go next.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOppressively competent, Aunt Mildred would talk endlessly of her husband and\nher odious prodigies of babies to Valancy, because Valancy would be the only\none she could find to put up with it. For the same reason, Cousin\nGladys\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdreally First Cousin Gladys once removed, according to the strict\nway in which the Stirlings tabulated relationship\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda tall, thin lady who\nadmitted she had a sensitive disposition, would describe minutely the tortures\nof her neuritis. And Olive, the wonder girl of the whole Stirling clan, who had\neverything Valancy had not\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbeauty, popularity, love,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwould show off\nher beauty and presume on her popularity and flaunt her diamond insignia of\nlove in Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds dazzled, envious eyes.",
            "There would be none of all this today. And there would be no packing up of\nteaspoons. The packing up was always left for Valancy and Cousin Stickles. And\nonce, six years ago, a silver teaspoon from Aunt Wellington\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds wedding set had\nbeen lost. Valancy never heard the last of that silver teaspoon. Its ghost\nappeared Banquo-like at every subsequent family feast.",
            "Oh, yes, Valancy knew exactly what the picnic would be like and she blessed the\nrain that had saved her from it. There would be no picnic this year. If Aunt\nWellington could not celebrate on the sacred day itself she would have no\ncelebration at all. Thank whatever gods there were for that.",
            "Since there would be no picnic, Valancy made up her mind that, if the rain held\nup in the afternoon, she would go up to the library and get another of John\nFoster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds books. Valancy was never allowed to read novels, but John Foster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nbooks were not novels. They were \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnature books\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdso the librarian told\nMrs. Frederick Stirling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdall about the woods and birds and bugs and\nthings like that, you know.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd So Valancy was allowed to read them\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdunder\nprotest, for it was only too evident that she enjoyed them too much. It was\npermissible, even laudable, to read to improve your mind and your religion, but\na book that was enjoyable was dangerous. Valancy did not know whether her mind\nwas being improved or not; but she felt vaguely that if she had come across\nJohn Foster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds books years ago life might have been a different thing for her.\nThey seemed to her to yield glimpses of a world into which she might once have\nentered, though the door was forever barred to her now. It was only within the\nlast year that John Foster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds books had been in the Deerwood library, though the\nlibrarian told Valancy that he had been a well-known writer for several years.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhere does he live?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Valancy had asked.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNobody knows. From his books he must be a Canadian, but no more information\ncan be had. His publishers won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say a word. Quite likely John Foster is a nom\nde plume. His books are so popular we can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt keep them in at all, though I\nreally can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt see what people find in them to rave over.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI think they\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre wonderful,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy, timidly.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOh\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwell\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Miss Clarkson smiled in a patronising fashion that\nrelegated Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds opinions to limbo, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt say I care much for bugs\nmyself. But certainly Foster seems to know all there is to know about them.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know whether she cared much for bugs either. It was not John\nFoster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds uncanny knowledge of wild creatures and insect life that enthralled\nher. She could hardly say what it was\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsome tantalising lure of a mystery\nnever revealed\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsome hint of a great secret just a little further\non\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsome faint, elusive echo of lovely, forgotten things\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdJohn\nFoster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds magic was indefinable.",
            "Yes, she would get a new Foster book. It was a month since she had Thistle\nHarvest, so surely Mother could not object. Valancy had read it four\ntimes\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe knew whole passages off by heart.",
            "And\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe almost thought she would go and see Dr. Trent about that queer\npain around the heart. It had come rather often lately, and the palpitations\nwere becoming annoying, not to speak of an occasional dizzy moment and a queer\nshortness of breath. But could she go to see him without telling any one? It\nwas a most daring thought. None of the Stirlings ever consulted a doctor\nwithout holding a family council and getting Uncle James\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd approval.\nThen, they went to Dr. Ambrose Marsh of Port Lawrence, who had married\nSecond Cousin Adelaide Stirling.",
            "But Valancy disliked Dr. Ambrose Marsh. And, besides, she could not get to Port\nLawrence, fifteen miles away, without being taken there. She did not want any\none to know about her heart. There would be such a fuss made and every member\nof the family would come down and talk it over and advise her and caution her\nand warn her and tell her horrible tales of great-aunts and cousins forty times\nremoved who had been \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdjust like that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and \u00ef\u00bf\u00bddropped dead without a moment\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nwarning, my dear.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAunt Isabel would remember that she had always said Doss looked like a girl who\nwould have heart trouble\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdso pinched and peaked always\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd; and Uncle\nWellington would take it as a personal insult, when \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdno Stirling ever had heart\ndisease before\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd; and Georgiana would forebode in perfectly audible asides that\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdpoor, dear little Doss isn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt long for this world, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm afraid\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd; and Cousin\nGladys would say, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhy, my heart has been like that for years,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nin a tone that implied no one else had any business even to have a heart; and\nOlive\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOlive would merely look beautiful and superior and disgustingly\nhealthy, as if to say, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhy all this fuss over a faded superfluity like Doss\nwhen you have me?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy felt that she couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt tell anybody unless she had to. She felt quite\nsure there was nothing at all seriously wrong with her heart and no need of all\nthe pother that would ensue if she mentioned it. She would just slip up quietly\nand see Dr. Trent that very day. As for his bill, she had the two hundred\ndollars that her father had put in the bank for her the day she was born. She\nwas never allowed to use even the interest of this, but she would secretly take\nout enough to pay Dr. Trent.",
            "Dr. Trent was a gruff, outspoken, absent-minded old fellow, but he was a\nrecognised authority on heart disease, even if he were only a general\npractitioner in out-of-the-world Deerwood. Dr. Trent was over seventy and there\nhad been rumours that he meant to retire soon. None of the Stirling clan had\never gone to him since he had told Cousin Gladys, ten years before, that her\nneuritis was all imaginary and that she enjoyed it. You couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt patronise a\ndoctor who insulted your first-cousin-once-removed like that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnot to\nmention that he was a Presbyterian when all the Stirlings went to the Anglican\nchurch. But Valancy, between the devil of disloyalty to clan and the deep sea\nof fuss and clatter and advice, thought she would take a chance with the devil."

As long as she could remember,\nCousin Stickles had knocked at her door at half-past seven. Cousin Stickles and\nMrs. Frederick Stirling had been up since seven, but Valancy was allowed to lie\nabed half an hour longer because of a family tradition that she was delicate.\nValancy got up, though she hated getting up more this morning than ever she had\nbefore. What was there to get up for? Another dreary day like all the days that\nhad preceded it, full of meaningless little tasks, joyless and unimportant,\nthat benefited nobody. But if she did not get up at once she would not be ready\nfor breakfast at eight o\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdclock. Hard and fast times for meals were the rule in\nMrs. Stirling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds household.

On the twenty-first of October Mrs. Frederick began cooking\nover the kitchen range and lighted a fire in the sitting-room stove in the\nevenings.

Of late years she had fallen into the habit of doing her\nhair with the shade of the window by the looking-glass pulled down. The lines\non her face did not show so plainly then. But this morning she jerked the shade\nto the very top and looked at herself in the leprous mirror with a passionate\ndetermination to see herself as the world saw her.",

She had somehow escaped the\nfamily high cheek-bones, and her dark-brown eyes, too soft and shadowy to be\nblack, had a slant that was almost Oriental. Apart from her eyes she was\nneither pretty nor ugly\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdjust insignificant-looking, she concluded\nbitterly. How plain the lines around her eyes and mouth were in that merciless\nlight! And never had her narrow, white face looked so narrow and so white.",

If we wish to be friends we must\nseek them out and win them by frequent, reverent visits at all hours; by\nmorning, by noon, and by night; and at all seasons, in spring, in summer, in\nautumn, in winter. Otherwise we can never really know them and any pretence we\nmay make to the contrary will never impose on them. They have their own\neffective way of keeping aliens at a distance and shutting their hearts to mere\ncasual sightseers. It is of no use to seek the woods from any motive except\nsheer love of them; they will find us out at once and hide all their sweet,\nold-world secrets from us. But if they know we come to them because we love\nthem they will be very kind to us and give us such treasures of beauty and\ndelight as are not bought or sold in any market-place. For the woods, when they\ngive at all, give unstintedly and hold nothing back from their true\nworshippers. We must go to them lovingly, humbly, patiently, watchfully, and we\nshall learn what poignant loveliness lurks in the wild places and silent\nintervals, lying under starshine and sunset, what cadences of unearthly music\nare harped on aged pine boughs or crooned in copses of fir, what delicate\nsavours exhale from mosses and ferns in sunny corners or on damp brooklands,\nwhat dreams and myths and legends of an older time haunt them. Then the\nimmortal heart of the woods will beat against ours and its subtle life will\nsteal into our veins and make us its own forever, so that no matter where we go\nor how widely we wander we shall yet be drawn back to the forest to find our\nmost enduring kinship.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDoss,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd called her mother from the hall below, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhat are you doing all by\nyourself in that room?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy dropped Thistle Harvest like a hot coal and fled downstairs to\nher patches; but she felt the strange exhilaration of spirit that always came\nmomentarily to her when she dipped into one of John Foster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds books.

No one else was in the\nchurch\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnobody except the new rector, Dr. Stalling. Dr. Stalling stood up\nin front of the choir door, beckoned to her, and said sternly, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdLittle boy,\ncome up here.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy had stared around her. There was no little boy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthere was no one\nin all the huge church but herself. This strange man with the blue glasses\ncouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt mean her. She was not a boy.",

She was too terrified\nto do anything else. What dreadful thing was going to happen to her? What\nhad happened to her? Had she actually turned into a boy?

Dr. Stalling shook his forefinger\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsuch a\nlong, knuckly forefinger\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdat her and said:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdLittle boy, take off your hat.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy took off her hat.

No, she would\nnot go; she would get a bottle of Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Purple Pills instead. Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nPurple Pills were the standard medicine of the Stirling clan. Had they not\ncured Second Cousin Geraldine when five doctors had given her up?

She would glance over the magazines in the reading-room a\nfew minutes and then go home.",
            "Valancy tried to read a story, but it made her furious. On every page was a\npicture of the heroine surrounded by adoring men.

Not only was she a failure as a relative and non-existent as a\nsweetheart or friend, but she was not even of any importance as a patient.

The young man\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds arm was around the girl\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds waist quite\nshamelessly. Valancy had never walked with a man\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds arm about her.

It was called \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDoss\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds rosebush.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Cousin Georgiana had\ngiven it to Valancy five years ago and Valancy had planted it joyfully. She\nloved roses. But\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdof course\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe rosebush never bloomed. That was her\nluck. Valancy did everything she could think of and took the advice of\neverybody in the clan, but still the rosebush would not bloom. It throve and\ngrew luxuriantly, with great leafy branches untouched of rust or spider; but\nnot even a bud had ever appeared on it. Valancy, looking at it two days after\nher birthday, was filled with a sudden, overwhelming hatred for it. The thing\nwouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt bloom: very well, then, she would cut it down. She marched to the\ntool-room in the barn for her garden knife and she went at the rosebush\nviciously. A few minutes later horrified Mrs. Frederick came out to the\nverandah and beheld her daughter slashing insanely among the rosebush boughs.\nHalf of them were already strewn on the walk. The bush looked sadly dismantled.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDoss, what on earth are you doing? Have you gone crazy?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNo,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy. She meant to say it defiantly, but habit was too strong for\nher. She said it deprecatingly. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI just made up my mind to cut this\nbush down. It is no good. It never blooms\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnever will bloom.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThat is no reason for destroying it,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Mrs. Frederick sternly. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt was a\nbeautiful bush and quite ornamental. You have made a sorry-looking thing of\nit.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRose trees should bloom,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy a little obstinately.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt argue with me, Doss. Clear up that mess and leave the bush alone.\nI don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know what Georgiana will say when she sees how you have hacked it to\npieces. Really, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm surprised at you. And to do it without consulting\nme!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe bush is mine,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd muttered Valancy.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds that? What did you say, Doss?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI only said the bush was mine,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd repeated Valancy humbly.",
            "Mrs. Frederick turned without a word and marched back into the house. The\nmischief was done now. Valancy knew she had offended her mother deeply and\nwould not be spoken to or noticed in any way for two or three days. Cousin\nStickles would see to Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bringing-up but Mrs. Frederick would preserve\nthe stony silence of outraged majesty.",
            "Valancy sighed and put away her garden knife, hanging it precisely on its\nprecise nail in the tool-shop. She cleared away the severed branches and swept\nup the leaves. Her lips twitched as she looked at the straggling bush. It had\nan odd resemblance to its shaken, scrawny donor, little Cousin Georgiana\nherself.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI certainly have made an awful-looking thing of it,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd thought Valancy.",
            "But she did not feel repentant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdonly sorry she had offended her mother.\nThings would be so uncomfortable until she was forgiven. Mrs. Frederick was one\nof those women who can make their anger felt all over a house. Walls and doors\nare no protection from it.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd better go uptown and git the mail,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Cousin Stickles, when Valancy\nwent in. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt go\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI feel all sorter peaky and piny this spring.\nI want you to stop at the drugstore and git me a bottle of Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Blood\nBitters. There\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nothing like Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Bitters for building a body up. Cousin\nJames says the Purple Pills are the best, but I know better. My poor dear\nhusband took Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Bitters right up to the day he died. Don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt let them\ncharge you more\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdn ninety cents. I kin git it for that at the Port. And what\nhave you been saying to your poor mother? Do you ever stop to think,\nDoss, that you kin only have one mother?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOne is enough for me,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd thought Valancy undutifully, as she went uptown.",
            "She got Cousin Stickles\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd bottle of bitters and then she went to the post-office\nand asked for her mail at the General Delivery. Her mother did not have a box.\nThey got too little mail to bother with it. Valancy did not expect any mail,\nexcept the Christian Times, which was the only paper they took. They\nhardly ever got any letters. But Valancy rather liked to stand in the office\nand watch Mr. Carewe, the grey-bearded, Santa-Clausy old clerk, handing out\nletters to the lucky people who did get them. He did it with such a detached,\nimpersonal, Jove-like air, as if it did not matter in the least to him what\nsupernal joys or shattering horrors might be in those letters for the people to\nwhom they were addressed. Letters had a fascination for Valancy, perhaps\nbecause she so seldom got any. In her Blue Castle exciting epistles, bound with\nsilk and sealed with crimson, were always being brought to her by pages in\nlivery of gold and blue, but in real life her only letters were occasional\nperfunctory notes from relatives or an advertising circular.",
            "Consequently she was immensely surprised when Mr. Carewe, looking even more\nJovian than usual, poked a letter out to her. Yes, it was addressed to her\nplainly, in a fierce, black hand: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMiss Valancy Stirling, Elm Street,\nDeerwood\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand the postmark was Montreal. Valancy picked it up with a\nlittle quickening of her breath. Montreal! It must be from Doctor Trent. He had\nremembered her, after all.",
            "Valancy met Uncle Benjamin coming in as she was going out and was glad the\nletter was safely in her bag.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhat,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Uncle Benjamin, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdis the difference between a donkey and a\npostage-stamp?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know. What?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd answered Valancy dutifully.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOne you lick with a stick and the other you stick with a lick. Ha, ha!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdUncle Benjamin passed in, tremendously pleased with himself.",
            "Cousin Stickles pounced on the Times when Valancy got home, but it did\nnot occur to her to ask if there were any letters. Mrs. Frederick would have\nasked it, but Mrs. Frederick\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds lips at present were sealed. Valancy was glad of\nthis. If her mother had asked if there were any letters Valancy would have had\nto admit there was. Then she would have had to let her mother and Cousin\nStickles read the letter and all would be discovered.",
            "Her heart acted strangely on the way upstairs, and she sat down by her window\nfor a few minutes before opening her letter. She felt very guilty and\ndeceitful. She had never before kept a letter secret from her mother. Every\nletter she had ever written or received had been read by Mrs. Frederick. That\nhad never mattered. Valancy had never had anything to hide. But this did\nmatter. She could not have any one see this letter. But her fingers trembled\nwith a consciousness of wickedness and unfilial conduct as she opened\nit\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtrembled a little, too, perhaps, with apprehension. She felt quite\nsure there was nothing seriously wrong with her heart but\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdone never knew.",
            "Dr. Trent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds letter was like himself\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdblunt, abrupt, concise, wasting no\nwords. Dr. Trent never beat about the bush. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDear Miss Sterling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand then\na page of black, positive writing. Valancy seemed to read it at a glance; she\ndropped it on her lap, her face ghost-white.",
            "Dr. Trent told her that she had a very dangerous and fatal form of heart\ndisease\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdangina pectoris\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdevidently complicated with an\naneurism\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhatever that was\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand in the last stages. He said, without\nmincing matters, that nothing could be done for her. If she took great care of\nherself she might live a year\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbut she might also die at any\nmoment\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDr. Trent never troubled himself about euphemisms. She must be\ncareful to avoid all excitement and all severe muscular efforts. She must eat\nand drink moderately, she must never run, she must go upstairs and uphill with\ngreat care. Any sudden jolt or shock might be fatal. She was to get the\nprescription he enclosed filled and carry it with her always, taking a dose\nwhenever her attacks came on. And he was hers truly, H. B. Trent.",
            "Valancy sat for a long while by her window. Outside was a world drowned in the\nlight of a spring afternoon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdskies entrancingly blue, winds perfumed and\nfree, lovely, soft, blue hazes at the end of every street. Over at the railway\nstation a group of young girls was waiting for a train; she heard their gay\nlaughter as they chattered and joked. The train roared in and roared out again.\nBut none of these things had any reality. Nothing had any reality except the\nfact that she had only another year to live.",
            "When she was tired of sitting at the window she went over and lay down on her\nbed, staring at the cracked, discoloured ceiling. The curious numbness that\nfollows on a staggering blow possessed her. She did not feel anything except a\nboundless surprise and incredulity\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbehind which was the conviction that\nDr. Trent knew his business and that she, Valancy Stirling, who had never\nlived, was about to die.",
            "When the gong rang for supper Valancy got up and went downstairs mechanically,\nfrom force of habit. She wondered that she had been let alone so long. But of\ncourse her mother would not pay any attention to her just now. Valancy was\nthankful for this. She thought the quarrel over the rosebush had been really,\nas Mrs. Frederick herself might have said, Providential. She could not eat\nanything, but both Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles thought this was because\nshe was deservedly unhappy over her mother\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds attitude, and her lack of appetite\nwas not commented on. Valancy forced herself to swallow a cup of tea and then\nsat and watched the others eat, with an odd feeling that years had passed since\nshe had sat with them at the dinner-table. She found herself smiling inwardly\nto think what a commotion she could make if she chose. Let her merely tell them\nwhat was in Dr. Trent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds letter and there would be as much fuss made as\nif\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy thought bitterly\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthey really cared two straws about her.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDr. Trent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds housekeeper got word from him today,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Cousin Stickles, so\nsuddenly that Valancy jumped guiltily. Was there anything in thought waves?\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMrs. Judd was talking to her uptown. They think his son will recover, but Dr.\nTrent wrote that if he did he was going to take him abroad as soon as he was\nable to travel and wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be back here for a year at least.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThat will not matter much to us,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Mrs. Frederick majestically. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHe\nis not our doctor. I would not\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhere she looked or seemed to look\naccusingly right through Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhave him to doctor a sick cat.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMay I go upstairs and lie down?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy faintly. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI have a\nheadache.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhat has given you a headache?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd asked Cousin Stickles, since Mrs. Frederick\nwould not. The question had to be asked. Valancy could not be allowed to have\nheadaches without interference.",

She had had to be so polite all her life.",

She made a\ndiscovery that surprised her: she, who had been afraid of almost everything in\nlife, was not afraid of death. It did not seem in the least terrible to her.\nAnd she need not now be afraid of anything else. Why had she been afraid of\nthings? Because of life. Afraid of Uncle Benjamin because of the menace of\npoverty in old age. But now she would never be\nold\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdneglected\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtolerated.

Valancy shuddered at the thought of it.\nShe couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt endure it. Oh, she knew so well how it would be. First there would\nbe indignation\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyes, indignation on the part of Uncle James because she\nhad gone to a doctor\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdany doctor\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwithout consulting HIM.

She would be taken to Dr. Marsh, and when Dr.\nMarsh confirmed Dr. Trent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds diagnosis she would be taken to specialists in\nToronto and Montreal.

Valancy was good at making dust-piles\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthere\nwas an art in it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand she had secret hopes of leading. But Olive, working\noff by herself, was suddenly discovered to have a larger dust-pile than\nanybody. Valancy felt no jealousy. Her dust-pile was quite big enough to please\nher. Then one of the older girls had an inspiration.",

            "A frenzy seemed to seize the girls. They swooped down on the dust-piles with\npails and shovels and in a few seconds Olive\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds pile was a veritable pyramid. In\nvain Valancy, with scrawny, outstretched little arms, tried to protect hers.\nShe was ruthlessly swept aside, her dust-pile scooped up and poured on Olive\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds.\nValancy turned away resolutely and began building another dust-pile. Again a\nbigger girl pounced on it. Valancy stood before it, flushed, indignant, arms\noutspread.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt take it,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she pleaded. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdPlease don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt take it.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBut why?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd demanded the older girl. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhy won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt you help to build Olive\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nbigger?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI want my own little dust-pile,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy piteously.",
            "Her plea went unheeded. While she argued with one girl another scraped up her\ndust-pile. Valancy turned away, her heart swelling, her eyes full of tears.",

            "Valancy was neither jealous nor selfish. It was only that she wanted a\ndust-pile of her own\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsmall or big mattered not. A team of horses came\ndown the street\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOlive\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds dust pile was scattered over the\nroadway\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe bell rang\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe girls trooped into school and had\nforgotten the whole affair before they reached their seats. Valancy never\nforgot it. To this day she resented it in her secret soul. But was it not\nsymbolical of her life?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never been able to have my own dust-pile,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd thought Valancy.",
            "The enormous red moon she had seen rising right at the end of the street one\nautumn evening of her sixth year. She had been sick and cold with the awful,\nuncanny horror of it. So near to her. So big. She had run in trembling to her\nmother and her mother had laughed at her. She had gone to bed and hidden her\nface under the clothes in terror lest she might look at the window and see that\nhorrible moon glaring in at her through it.",
            "The boy who had tried to kiss her at a party when she was fifteen. She had not\nlet him\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe had evaded him and run. He was the only boy who had ever\ntried to kiss her. Now, fourteen years later, Valancy found herself wishing\nthat she had let him.",

            "That summer when Olive had the most beautiful hat, trimmed with creamy yellow\nnet, with a wreath of red roses and little ribbon bows under the chin. Valancy\nhad wanted a hat like that more than she had ever wanted anything. She pleaded\nfor one and had been laughed at\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdall summer she had to wear a horrid\nlittle brown sailor with elastic that cut behind her ears. None of the girls\nwould go around with her because she was so shabby\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnobody but Olive.\nPeople had thought Olive so sweet and unselfish.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI was an excellent foil for her,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd thought Valancy. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdEven then she knew that.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy had tried to win a prize for attendance in Sunday School once. But\nOlive won it. There were so many Sundays Valancy had to stay home because she\nhad colds. She had once tried to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsay a piece\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in school one Friday afternoon\nand had broken down in it. Olive was a good reciter and never got stuck.",
            "The night she had spent in Port Lawrence with Aunt Isabel when she was ten.\nByron Stirling was there; from Montreal, twelve years old, conceited, clever.\nAt family prayers in the morning Byron had reached across and given Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nthin arm such a savage pinch that she screamed out with pain. After prayers\nwere over she was summoned to Aunt Isabel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bar of judgment. But when she said\nByron had pinched her Byron denied it. He said she cried out because the kitten\nscratched her. He said she had put the kitten up on her chair and was playing\nwith it when she should have been listening to Uncle David\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds prayer. He was\nbelieved. In the Stirling clan the boys were always believed before the\ngirls. Valancy was sent home in disgrace because of her exceedingly bad\nbehavior during family prayers and she was not asked to Aunt Isabel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds again for\nmany moons.",
            "The time Cousin Betty Stirling was married. Somehow Valancy got wind of the\nfact that Betty was going to ask her to be one of her bridesmaids. Valancy was\nsecretly uplifted. It would be a delightful thing to be a bridesmaid. And of\ncourse she would have to have a new dress for it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda pretty new\ndress\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda pink dress. Betty wanted her bridesmaids to dress in pink.",
            "But Betty had never asked her, after all. Valancy couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt guess why, but long\nafter her secret tears of disappointment had been dried Olive told her. Betty,\nafter much consultation and reflection, had decided that Valancy was too\ninsignificant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe would \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdspoil the effect.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd That was nine years ago. But\ntonight Valancy caught her breath with the old pain and sting of it.",
            "That day in her eleventh year when her mother had badgered her into confessing\nsomething she had never done. Valancy had denied it for a long time but\neventually for peace\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd sake she had given in and pleaded guilty. Mrs. Frederick\nwas always making people lie by pushing them into situations where they\nhad to lie. Then her mother had made her kneel down on the parlour\nfloor, between herself and Cousin Stickles, and say, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdO God, please forgive me\nfor not speaking the truth.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Valancy had said it, but as she rose from her\nknees she muttered. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBut, O God, you know I did speak the truth.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\nValancy had not then heard of Galileo but her fate was similar to his. She was\npunished just as severely as if she hadn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt confessed and prayed.",
            "The winter she went to dancing-school. Uncle James had decreed she should go\nand had paid for her lessons. How she had looked forward to it! And how she had\nhated it! She had never had a voluntary partner. The teacher always had to tell\nsome boy to dance with her, and generally he had been sulky about it. Yet\nValancy was a good dancer, as light on her feet as thistledown. Olive, who\nnever lacked eager partners, was heavy.",
            "The affair of the button-string, when she was ten. All the girls in school had\nbutton-strings. Olive had a very long one with a great many beautiful buttons.\nValancy had one. Most of the buttons on it were very commonplace, but she had\nsix beauties that had come off Grandmother Stirling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nwedding-gown\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsparkling buttons of gold and glass, much more beautiful\nthan any Olive had. Their possession conferred a certain distinction on\nValancy. She knew every little girl in school envied her the exclusive\npossession of those beautiful buttons. When Olive saw them on the button-string\nshe had looked at them narrowly but said nothing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthen. The next day Aunt\nWellington had come to Elm Street and told Mrs. Frederick that she thought\nOlive should have some of those buttons\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdGrandmother Stirling was just as\nmuch Wellington\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds mother as Frederick\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds. Mrs. Frederick had agreed amiably. She\ncould not afford to fall out with Aunt Wellington. Moreover, the matter was of\nno importance whatever. Aunt Wellington carried off four of the buttons,\ngenerously leaving two for Valancy. Valancy had torn these from her string and\nflung them on the floor\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe had not yet learned that it was unladylike to\nhave feelings\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand had been sent supperless to bed for the exhibition.",
            "The night of Margaret Blunt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds party. She had made such pathetic efforts to be\npretty that night. Rob Walker was to be there; and two nights before, on the\nmoonlit verandah of Uncle Herbert\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds cottage at Mistawis, Rob had really seemed\nattracted to her. At Margaret\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds party Rob never even asked her to\ndance\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddid not notice her at all. She was a wallflower, as usual. That, of\ncourse, was years ago. People in Deerwood had long since given up inviting\nValancy to dances. But to Valancy its humiliation and disappointment were of\nthe other day. Her face burned in the darkness as she recalled herself, sitting\nthere with her pitifully crimped, thin hair and the cheeks she had pinched for\nan hour before coming, in an effort to make them red. All that came of it was a\nwild story that Valancy Stirling was rouged at Margaret Blunt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds party. In those\ndays in Deerwood that was enough to wreck your character forever. It did not\nwreck Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, or even damage it. People knew she couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be fast if\nshe tried. They only laughed at her.",

I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never even had a grief. And have I\never really loved anybody? Do I really love Mother? No, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.

Nothing!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Valancy ejaculated the last \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnothing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd aloud passionately.\nThen she moaned and stopped thinking about anything for a while. One of her\nattacks of pain had come on.",
            "When it was over something had happened to Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdperhaps the\nculmination of the process that had been going on in her mind ever since she\nhad read Dr. Trent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds letter. It was three o\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdclock in the morning\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe\nwisest and most accursed hour of the clock. But sometimes it sets us free.",

            "But Mrs. Frederick and Cousin Stickles had noticed a few things that made them\nuneasy before the dinner. It had begun with the rosebush, of course; and\nValancy never was really \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdquite right\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd again. She did not seem to worry in the\nleast over the fact that her mother was not speaking to her. You would never\nsuppose she noticed it at all. She had flatly refused to take either Purple\nPills or Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Bitters. She had announced coolly that she did not intend to\nanswer to the name of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDoss\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd any longer. She had told Cousin Stickles that she\nwished she would give up wearing that brooch with Cousin Artemas Stickles\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd hair\nin it.

            "Valancy would not have cared in the least if they had left her at home. These\nfamily celebrations were all hopelessly dull. But the Stirlings always\ncelebrated everything. It was a long-established custom. Even Mrs. Frederick\ngave a dinner party on her wedding anniversary and Cousin Stickles had friends\nin to supper on her birthday. Valancy hated these entertainments because they\nhad to pinch and save and contrive for weeks afterwards to pay for them. But\nshe wanted to go to the silver wedding. It would hurt Uncle Herbert\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds feelings\nif she stayed away, and she rather liked Uncle Herbert. Besides, she wanted to\nlook over all her relatives from her new angle. It would be an excellent place\nto make public her declaration of independence if occasion offered.",

Aunt Isabel had\ndecreed that Valancy should never wear colours. They did not become her. When\nshe was young they allowed her to wear white, but that had been tacitly dropped\nfor some years. Valancy put on the brown silk. It had a high collar and long\nsleeves. She had never had a dress with low neck and elbow sleeves, although\nthey had been worn, even in Deerwood, for over a year.

He was the only person\nin Deerwood who could be got to do odd jobs of carpentering and repairing when\nthey needed to be done, so it would not do to offend him.

That is, he got a Presbyterian preacher to marry him, baptise his\nchild and bury his wife; and he knew more about Presbyterian theology than most\nministers, which made him a terror to them in arguments.

Four years previously Cissy\nGay had gone up to a Muskoka hotel as a summer waitress. And when she had come\nback in the fall she was a changed creature. She hid herself away and went\nnowhere.

And\nnow look!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe baby had lived for a year. After its death Cissy faded away. Two years ago\nDr. Marsh had given her only six months to live\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdher lungs were hopelessly\ndiseased. But she was still alive. Nobody went to see her.

But Abel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds superannuated gallantry did\nnot worry Valancy. Besides, this was the first compliment she had ever received\nin her life and she found herself liking it. She sometimes suspected she had\nnice ankles, but nobody had ever mentioned it before. In the Stirling clan\nankles were among the unmentionables.",
            "Roaring Abel took her into the kitchen, where Cissy Gay was lying on the sofa,\nbreathing quickly, with little scarlet spots on her hollow cheeks. Valancy had\nnot seen Cecilia Gay for years. Then she had been such a pretty creature, a\nslight, blossom-like girl, with soft, golden hair, clear-cut, almost waxen\nfeatures, and large, beautiful blue eyes. She was shocked at the change in her.\nCould this be sweet Cissy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthis pitiful little thing that looked like a\ntired, broken flower? She had wept all the beauty out of her eyes; they looked\ntoo big\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdenormous\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdin her wasted face. The last time Valancy had seen\nCecilia Gay those faded, piteous eyes had been limpid, shadowy blue pools aglow\nwith mirth.

            "CHAPTER XVIIWhen Valancy had lived for a week at Roaring\nAbel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds she felt as if years had separated her from her old life and all the\npeople she had known in it. They were beginning to seem\nremote\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddream-like\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdfar-away\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand as the days went on they\nseemed still more so, until they ceased to matter altogether.",
            "She was happy. Nobody ever bothered her with conundrums or insisted on giving\nher Purple Pills. Nobody called her Doss or worried her about catching cold.\nThere were no quilts to piece, no abominable rubber-plant to water, no ice-cold\nmaternal tantrums to endure. She could be alone whenever she liked, go to bed\nwhen she liked, sneeze when she liked. In the long, wondrous, northern\ntwilights, when Cissy was asleep and Roaring Abel away, she could sit for hours\non the shaky back verandah steps, looking out over the barrens to the hills\nbeyond, covered with their fine, purple bloom, listening to the friendly wind\nsinging wild, sweet melodies in the little spruces, and drinking in the aroma\nof the sunned grasses, until darkness flowed over the landscape like a cool,\nwelcome wave.",
            "Sometimes of an afternoon, when Cissy was strong enough, the two girls went\ninto the barrens and looked at the wood-flowers. But they did not pick any.\nValancy had read to Cissy the gospel thereof according to John Foster: \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt is a\npity to gather wood-flowers. They lose half their witchery away from the green\nand the flicker. The way to enjoy wood-flowers is to track them down to their\nremote haunts\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgloat over them\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand then leave them with backward\nglances, taking with us only the beguiling memory of their grace and\nfragrance.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy was in the midst of realities after a lifetime of unrealities. And\nbusy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdvery busy. The house had to be cleaned. Not for nothing had Valancy\nbeen brought up in the Stirling habits of neatness and cleanliness. If she\nfound satisfaction in cleaning dirty rooms she got her fill of it there.\nRoaring Abel thought she was foolish to bother doing so much more than she was\nasked to do, but he did not interfere with her. He was very well satisfied with\nhis bargain. Valancy was a good cook. Abel said she got a flavour into things.\nThe only fault he found with her was that she did not sing at her work.",

Most days she was able to get up and\ndress\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsometimes even to work about in the garden or the barrens for an\nhour or two. For a few weeks after Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds coming she seemed so much better\nthat Valancy began to hope she might get well. But Cissy shook her head.",

She had been in the garden at twilight, hunting for a few stalks\nof white narcissus for Cissy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds room when she heard that terrible old Grey\nSlosson coming down through the woods from Mistawis\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdone could hear it\nmiles away.

Cousin Georgiana wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt such a bad\nold soul. Then she said:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAnd now that you have got all that out of your system, Cousin Georgiana, can\nyou tell me how to make creamed codfish so that it will not be as thick as\nporridge and as salt as the Dead Sea?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd* * * * * * *\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll just have to wait,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Uncle Benjamin. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAfter all, Cissy Gay\ncan\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt live long. Dr. Marsh tells me she may drop off any day.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMrs. Frederick wept. It would really have been so much easier to bear if\nValancy had died. She could have worn mourning then."

            "CHAPTER XXWhen Abel Gay paid Valancy her first month\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nwages\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhich he did promptly, in bills reeking with the odour of tobacco\nand whiskey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy went into Deerwood and spent every cent of it. She\ngot a pretty green cr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdpe dress with a girdle of crimson beads, at a bargain\nsale, a pair of silk stockings, to match, and a little crinkled green hat with\na crimson rose in it. She even bought a foolish little beribboned and belaced\nnightgown.",
            "She passed the house on Elm Street twice\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy never even thought about\nit as \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhome\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbut saw no one. No doubt her mother was sitting in the room\nthis lovely June evening playing solitaire\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand cheating. Valancy knew\nthat Mrs. Frederick always cheated. She never lost a game. Most of the people\nValancy met looked at her seriously and passed her with a cool nod. Nobody\nstopped to speak to her.",
            "Valancy put on her green dress when she got home. Then she took it off again.\nShe felt so miserably undressed in its low neck and short sleeves. And that\nlow, crimson girdle around the hips seemed positively indecent. She hung it up\nin the closet, feeling flatly that she had wasted her money. She would never\nhave the courage to wear that dress. John Foster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds arraignment of fear had no\npower to stiffen her against this. In this one thing habit and custom were\nstill all-powerful. Yet she sighed as she went down to meet Barney Snaith in\nher old snuff-brown silk. That green thing had been very becoming\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe had\nseen so much in her one ashamed glance. Above it her eyes had looked like odd\nbrown jewels and the girdle had given her flat figure an entirely different\nappearance. She wished she could have left it on. But there were some things\nJohn Foster did not know.",
            "Every Sunday evening Valancy went to the little Free Methodist church in a\nvalley on the edge of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda spireless little grey building among\nthe pines, with a few sunken graves and mossy gravestones in the small,\npaling-encircled, grass-grown square beside it. She liked the minister who\npreached there. He was so simple and sincere. An old man, who lived in Port\nLawrence and came out by the lake in a little disappearing propeller boat to\ngive a free service to the people of the small, stony farms back of the hills,\nwho would otherwise never have heard any gospel message. She liked the simple\nservice and the fervent singing. She liked to sit by the open window and look\nout into the pine woods. The congregation was always small. The Free Methodists\nwere few in number, poor and generally illiterate. But Valancy loved those\nSunday evenings. For the first time in her life she liked going to church. The\nrumour reached Deerwood that she had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdturned Free Methodist\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and sent Mrs.\nFrederick to bed for a day. But Valancy had not turned anything. She went to\nthe church because she liked it and because in some inexplicable way it did her\ngood. Old Mr. Towers believed exactly what he preached and somehow it made a\ntremendous difference.",
            "Oddly enough, Roaring Abel disapproved of her going to the hill church as\nstrongly as Mrs. Frederick herself could have done. He had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdno use for Free\nMethodists. He was a Presbyterian.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd But Valancy went in spite of him.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll hear something worse than that about her soon,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Uncle Benjamin\npredicted gloomily.",
            "They did.",
            "Valancy could not quite explain, even to herself, just why she wanted to go to\nthat party. It was a dance \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd at Chidley Corners; and dances at Chidley\nCorners were not, as a rule, the sort of assemblies where well-brought-up young\nladies were found. Valancy knew it was coming off, for Roaring Abel had been\nengaged as one of the fiddlers.",
            "But the idea of going had never occurred to her until Roaring Abel himself\nbroached it at supper.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou come with me to the dance,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he ordered. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll do you good\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdput some\ncolour in your face. You look peaked\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyou want something to liven you up.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy found herself suddenly wanting to go. She knew nothing at all of what\ndances at Chidley Corners were apt to be like. Her idea of dances had been\nfashioned on the correct affairs that went by that name in Deerwood and Port\nLawrence. Of course she knew the Corners\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd dance wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be just like them.\nMuch more informal, of course. But so much the more interesting. Why shouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\nshe go? Cissy was in a week of apparent health and improvement. She wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\nmind staying alone in the least. She entreated Valancy to go if she wanted to.\nAnd Valancy did want to go.",
            "She went to her room to dress. A rage against the snuff-brown silk seized her.\nWear that to a party! Never. She pulled her green cr\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdpe from its hanger and put\nit on feverishly. It was nonsense to feel so\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdso\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnaked\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdjust\nbecause her neck and arms were bare. That was just her old maidishness. She\nwould not be ridden by it. On went the dress\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe slippers.",
            "It was the first time she had worn a pretty dress since the organdies of her\nearly teens. And they had never made her look like this.",
            "If she only had a necklace or something. She wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt feel so bare then. She\nran down to the garden. There were clovers there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgreat crimson things\ngrowing in the long grass. Valancy gathered handfuls of them and strung them on\na cord. Fastened above her neck they gave her the comfortable sensation of a\ncollar and were oddly becoming. Another circlet of them went round her hair,\ndressed in the low puffs that became her. Excitement brought those faint pink\nstains to her face. She flung on her coat and pulled the little, twisty hat\nover her hair.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou look so nice and\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddifferent, dear,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Cissy. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdLike a\ngreen moonbeam with a gleam of red in it, if there could be such a thing.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy stooped to kiss her.",

I feel better tonight than I have for a long while.\nI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been feeling badly to see you sticking here so closely on my account. I\nhope you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll have a nice time. I never was at a party at the Corners, but I used\nto go sometimes, long ago, to dances up back. We always had good times. And you\nneedn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be afraid of Father being drunk tonight. He never drinks when he\nengages to play for a party. But\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthere may be\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdliquor. What will you\ndo if it gets rough?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNobody would molest me.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNot seriously, I suppose. Father would see to that. But it might be\nnoisy and\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand unpleasant.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt mind. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm only going as a looker-on. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt expect to dance. I just\nwant to see what a party up back is like. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve never seen anything\nexcept decorous Deerwood.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdCissy smiled rather dubiously. She knew much better than Valancy what a party\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd might be like if there should be liquor. But again there mightn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI hope you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll enjoy it, dear,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she repeated.",
            "Valancy enjoyed the drive there. They went early, for it was twelve miles to\nChidley Corners, and they had to go in Abel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds old, ragged top-buggy. The road\nwas rough and rocky, like most Muskoka roads, but full of the austere charm of\nnorthern woods. It wound through beautiful, purring pines that were ranks of\nenchantment in the June sunset, and over the curious jade-green rivers of\nMuskoka, fringed by aspens that were always quivering with some supernal joy.",
            "Roaring Abel was excellent company, too. He knew all the stories and legends of\nthe wild, beautiful \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and he told them to Valancy as they drove along.\nValancy had several fits of inward laughter over what Uncle Benjamin and Aunt\nWellington, et al., would feel and think and say if they saw her driving\nwith Roaring Abel in that terrible buggy to a dance at Chidley Corners.",
            "At first the dance was quiet enough, and Valancy was amused and entertained.\nShe even danced twice herself, with a couple of nice \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd boys who danced\nbeautifully and told her she did, too.",
            "Another compliment came her way\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnot a very subtle one, perhaps, but\nValancy had had too few compliments in her life to be over-nice on that point.\nShe overheard two of the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd young men talking about her in the dark\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlean-to\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd behind her.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdKnow who that girl in green is?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNope. Guess she\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds from out front. The Port, maybe. Got a stylish look to her.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNo beaut but cute-looking, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll say. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdJever see such eyes?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe big room was decorated with pine and fir boughs, and lighted by Chinese\nlanterns. The floor was waxed, and Roaring Abel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds fiddle, purring under his\nskilled touch, worked magic. The \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd girls were pretty and prettily\ndressed. Valancy thought it the nicest party she had ever attended.",
            "By eleven o\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdclock she had changed her mind. A new crowd had arrived\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda\ncrowd unmistakably drunk. Whiskey began to circulate freely. Very soon almost\nall the men were partly drunk. Those in the porch and outside around the door\nbegan howling \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcome-all-ye\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and continued to howl them. The room grew noisy\nand reeking. Quarrels started up here and there. Bad language and obscene songs\nwere heard. The girls, swung rudely in the dances, became dishevelled and\ntawdry. Valancy, alone in her corner, was feeling disgusted and repentant. Why\nhad she ever come to such a place? Freedom and independence were all very well,\nbut one should not be a little fool. She might have known what it would be\nlike\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe might have taken warning from Cissy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds guarded sentences. Her\nhead was aching\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe was sick of the whole thing. But what could she do?\nShe must stay to the end. Abel could not leave till then. And that would\nprobably be not till three or four in the morning.",
            "The new influx of boys had left the girls far in the minority and partners were\nscarce. Valancy was pestered with invitations to dance. She refused them all\nshortly, and some of her refusals were not well taken. There were muttered\noaths and sullen looks. Across the room she saw a group of the strangers\ntalking together and glancing meaningly at her. What were they plotting?It was at this moment that she saw Barney Snaith looking in over the heads of\nthe crowd at the doorway. Valancy had two distinct convictions\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdone was\nthat she was quite safe now; the other was that this was why she had\nwanted to come to the dance. It had been such an absurd hope that she had not\nrecognised it before, but now she knew she had come because of the possibility\nthat Barney might be there, too. She thought that perhaps she ought to be\nashamed for this, but she wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt. After her feeling of relief her next feeling\nwas one of annoyance with Barney for coming there unshaved. Surely he might\nhave enough self-respect to groom himself up decently when he went to a party.\nThere he was, bareheaded, bristly-chinned, in his old trousers and his blue\nhomespun shirt. Not even a coat. Valancy could have shaken him in her anger. No\nwonder people believed everything bad of him.",
            "But she was not afraid any longer. One of the whispering group left his\ncomrades and came across the room to her, through the whirling couples that now\nfilled it uncomfortably. He was a tall, broad-shouldered fellow, not\nill-dressed or ill-looking but unmistakably half drunk. He asked Valancy to\ndance. Valancy declined civilly. His face turned livid. He threw his arm about\nher and pulled her to him. His hot, whiskied breath burned her face.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have fine-lady airs here, my girl. If you ain\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt too good to come here\nyou ain\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt too good to dance with us. Me and my pals have been watching you.\nYou\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve got to give us each a turn and a kiss to boot.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy tried desperately and vainly to free herself. She was being dragged out\ninto the maze of shouting, stamping, yelling dancers. The next moment the man\nwho held her went staggering across the room from a neatly planted blow on the\njaw, knocking down whirling couples as he went. Valancy felt her arm grasped.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThis way\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdquick,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Barney Snaith. He swung her out through the open\nwindow behind them, vaulted lightly over the sill and caught her hand.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdQuick\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwe must run for it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthey\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll be after us.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy ran as she had never run before, clinging tight to Barney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds hand,\nwondering why she did not drop dead in such a mad scamper. Suppose she did!\nWhat a scandal it would make for her poor people. For the first time Valancy\nfelt a little sorry for them. Also, she felt glad that she had escaped from\nthat horrible row. Also, glad that she was holding tight to Barney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds hand. Her\nfeelings were badly mixed and she had never had so many in such a brief time in\nher life.",
            "They finally reached a quiet corner in the pine woods. The pursuit had taken a\ndifferent direction and the whoops and yells behind them were growing faint.\nValancy, out of breath, with a crazily beating heart, collapsed on the trunk of\na fallen pine.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThanks,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she gasped.",

So I came on up here instead of going to\nDeerwood.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy felt a sudden delightful glow irradiating soul and body under the dark\npines.

The tall mulleins stood up along the road in stiff, orderly\nranks like companies of soldiers. The thistles looked like drunken fairies or\ntipsy elves as their car-lights passed over them. This was the first time she\nhad even been in a car. After all, she liked it. She was not in the least\nafraid, with Barney at the wheel. Her spirits rose rapidly as they tore along.\nShe ceased to feel ashamed. She ceased to feel anything except that she was\npart of a comet rushing gloriously through the night of space.",

If you cannot, friends you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdll never be and you need not waste time in\ntrying.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdEvidently John Foster says a sensible thing once in a while,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd conceded Barney.",
            "They sat in silence for a long while. Little rabbits hopped across the road.\nOnce or twice an owl laughed out delightfully. The road beyond them was fringed\nwith the woven shadow lace of trees. Away off to the southwest the sky was full\nof silvery little cirrus clouds above the spot where Barney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds island must be.",
            "Valancy was perfectly happy. Some things dawn on you slowly. Some things come\nby lightning flashes. Valancy had had a lightning flash.",
            "She knew quite well now that she loved Barney. Yesterday she had been all her\nown. Now she was this man\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds. Yet he had done nothing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsaid nothing. He had\nnot even looked at her as a woman. But that didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt matter. Nor did it matter\nwhat he was or what he had done. She loved him without any reservations.\nEverything in her went out wholly to him. She had no wish to stifle or disown\nher love. She seemed to be his so absolutely that thought apart from\nhim\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthought in which he did not predominate\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwas an impossibility.",
            "She had realised, quite simply and fully, that she loved him, in the moment\nwhen he was leaning on the car door, explaining that Lady Jane had no gas. She\nhad looked deep into his eyes in the moonlight and had known. In just that\ninfinitesimal space of time everything was changed. Old things passed away and\nall things became new.",
            "She was no longer unimportant, little, old maid Valancy Stirling. She was a\nwoman, full of love and therefore rich and significant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdjustified to\nherself. Life was no longer empty and futile, and death could cheat her of\nnothing. Love had cast out her last fear.",
            "Love! What a searing, torturing, intolerably sweet thing it was\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthis\npossession of body, soul and mind! With something at its core as fine and\nremote and purely spiritual as the tiny blue spark in the heart of the\nunbreakable diamond. No dream had ever been like this. She was no longer\nsolitary. She was one of a vast sisterhood\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdall the women who had ever\nloved in the world.",
            "Barney need never know it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthough she would not in the least have minded\nhis knowing. But she knew it and it made a tremendous difference to her.\nJust to love! She did not ask to be loved. It was rapture enough just to sit\nthere beside him in silence, alone in the summer night in the white splendour\nof moonshine, with the wind blowing down on them out of the pine woods. She had\nalways envied the wind. So free. Blowing where it listed. Through the hills.\nOver the lakes. What a tang, what a zip it had! What a magic of adventure!\nValancy felt as if she had exchanged her shop-worn soul for a fresh one,\nfire-new from the workshop of the gods. As far back as she could look, life had\nbeen dull\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcolourless\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsavourless. Now she had come to a little patch\nof violets, purple and fragrant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhers for the plucking. No matter who or\nwhat had been in Barney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds past\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdno matter who or what might be in his\nfuture\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdno one else could ever have this perfect hour.

            "The Stirlings all came to the funeral, men and women. They had had a family\nconclave over it.

No\nbeauty\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbut a fifty-year-old widower, Mr. Beck told himself very\nreasonably, couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt expect everything.

She lived half a mile out of Deerwood and she wanted to go in\nto Amelia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and find out if Doss had come home yet. Cousin Georgiana was\nanxious to see Doss. She had something very important to tell her. Something,\nshe was sure, Doss would be delighted to hear. Poor Doss! She had had\nrather a dull life of it. Cousin Georgiana owned to herself that she\nwould not like to live under Amelia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds thumb. But that would be all changed now.\nCousin Georgiana felt tremendously important. For the time being, she quite\nforgot to wonder which of them would go next.",
            "And here was Doss herself, coming along the road from Roaring Abel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds in such a\nqueer green dress and hat. Talk about luck. Cousin Georgiana would have a\nchance to impart her wonderful secret right away, with nobody else about to\ninterrupt. It was, you might say, a Providence.",
            "Valancy, who had been living for four days on her enchanted island, had decided\nthat she might as well go in to Deerwood and tell her relatives that she was\nmarried. Otherwise, finding that she had disappeared from Roaring Abel\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, they\nmight get out a search warrant for her. Barney had offered to drive her in, but\nshe had preferred to go alone. She smiled very radiantly at Cousin Georgiana,\nwho, she remembered, as of some one known a long time ago, had really been not\na bad little creature. Valancy was so happy that she could have smiled at\nanybody\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdeven Uncle James. She was not averse to Cousin Georgiana\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\ncompany.

There was certainly an air of\nsuppressed triumph about Cousin Georgiana. Could it be possible that Cousin\nGeorgiana was thinking of marrying again? Marrying Edward Beck? Absurd. Cousin\nGeorgiana was sixty-five if she were a day and her little anxious face was as\nclosely covered with fine wrinkles as if she had been a hundred.

            "One side of the wall was lined with rough, homemade book-shelves filled with\nbooks, and between the two side windows hung an old mirror in a faded gilt\nframe, with fat cupids gamboling in the panel over the glass. A mirror, Valancy\nthought, that must be like the fabled mirror into which Venus had once looked\nand which thereafter reflected as beautiful every woman who looked into it.\nValancy thought she was almost pretty in that mirror.

The moonlight\nwould begin to silver the Mistawis dusk. Bats would begin to swoop darkly\nagainst the pale, western gold. The little waterfall that came down on the high\nbank not far away would, by some whim of the wildwood gods, begin to look like\na wonderful white woman beckoning through the spicy, fragrant evergreens. And\nLeander would begin to chuckle diabolically on the mainland shore. How sweet it\nwas to sit there and do nothing in the beautiful silence, with Barney at the\nother side of the table, smoking!There were plenty of other islands in sight, though none were near enough to be\ntroublesome as neighbours. There was one little group of islets far off to the\nwest which they called the Fortunate Isles. At sunrise they looked like a\ncluster of emeralds, at sunset like a cluster of amethysts. They were too small\nfor houses; but the lights on the larger islands would bloom out all over the\nlake, and bonfires would be lighted on their shores, streaming up into the wood\nshadows and throwing great, blood-red ribbons over the waters. Music would\ndrift to them alluringly from boats here and there, or from the verandahs on\nthe big house of the millionaire on the biggest island.",

Valancy liked to watch its\nlighted windows flash by and wonder who was on it and what hopes and fears it\ncarried. She also amused herself by picturing Barney and herself going to the\ndances and dinners in the houses on the islands, but she did not want to go in\nreality. Once they did go to a masquerade dance in the pavilion at one of the\nhotels up the lake, and had a glorious evening, but slipped away in their\ncanoe, before unmasking time, back to the Blue Castle.",

And Valancy learned the real flavour of the strawberry in its\nhighest perfection. There was a certain sunlit dell on the banks of Mistawis\nalong which white birches grew on one side and on the other still, changeless\nranks of young spruces. There were long grasses at the roots of the birches,\ncombed down by the winds and wet with morning dew late into the afternoons.\nHere they found berries that might have graced the banquets of Lucullus, great\nambrosial sweetnesses hanging like rubies to long, rosy stalks.

When Valancy\ncarried any of these berries home that elusive essence escaped and they became\nnothing more than the common berries of the market-place\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdvery kitchenly\ngood indeed, but not as they would have been, eaten in their birch dell until\nher fingers were stained as pink as Aurora\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds eyelids.",

Was that dreadful\ncreature good to her? Was she warm enough at nights?Valancy was quite warm at nights. She used to wake up and revel silently in the\ncosiness of those winter nights on that little island in the frozen lake. The\nnights of other winters had been so cold and long. Valancy hated to wake up in\nthem and think about the bleakness and emptiness of the day that had passed and\nthe bleakness and emptiness of the day that would come. Now, she almost counted\nthat night lost on which she didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt wake up and lie awake for half an hour just\nbeing happy, while Barney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds regular breathing went on beside her, and through\nthe open door the smouldering brands in the fireplace winked at her in the\ngloom. It was very nice to feel a little Lucky cat jump up on your bed in the\ndarkness and snuggle down at your feet, purring; but Banjo would be sitting\ndourly by himself out in front of the fire like a brooding demon. At such\nmoments Banjo was anything but canny, but Valancy loved his uncanniness.",
            "The side of the bed had to be right against the window. There was no other\nplace for it in the tiny room. Valancy, lying there, could look out of the\nwindow, through the big pine boughs that actually touched it, away up Mistawis,\nwhite and lustrous as a pavement of pearl, or dark and terrible in the storm.\nSometimes the pine boughs tapped against the panes with friendly signals.\nSometimes she heard the little hissing whisper of snow against them right at\nher side. Some nights the whole outer world seemed given over to the empery of\nsilence; then came nights when there would be a majestic sweep of wind in the\npines; nights of dear starlight when it whistled freakishly and joyously around\nthe Blue Castle; brooding nights before storm when it crept along the floor of\nthe lake with a low, wailing cry of boding and mystery. Valancy wasted many\nperfectly good sleeping hours in these delightful communings. But she could\nsleep as long in the morning as she wanted to. Nobody cared. Barney cooked his\nown breakfast of bacon and eggs and then shut himself up in Bluebeard\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Chamber\ntill supper time. Then they had an evening of reading and talk. They talked\nabout everything in this world and a good many things in other worlds. They\nlaughed over their own jokes until the Blue Castles re-echoed.",

I used to giggle foolishly when I felt I\nwas expected to. But now\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe laugh just comes.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt struck Valancy more than once that Barney himself laughed a great deal\noftener than he used to and that his laugh had changed. It had become\nwholesome. She rarely heard the little cynical note in it now. Could a man\nlaugh like that who had crimes on his conscience? Yet Barney must have\ndone something. Valancy had indifferently made up her mind as to what he had\ndone. She concluded he was a defaulting bank cashier. She had found in one of\nBarney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds books an old clipping cut from a Montreal paper in which a vanished,\ndefaulting cashier was described.

Valancy had it all figured out in the back of her mind. Barney had been\nin a bank. He was tempted to take some money to speculate\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmeaning, of\ncourse, to put it back. He had got in deeper and deeper, until he found there\nwas nothing for it but flight. It had happened so to scores of men. He had,\nValancy was absolutely certain, never meant to do wrong.

            "Valancy had only one unhappy night that winter. It came in late March when most\nof the snow had gone and Nip and Tuck had returned. Barney had gone off in the\nafternoon for a long, woodland tramp, saying he would be back by dark if all\nwent well. Soon after he had gone it had begun to snow. The wind rose and\npresently Mistawis was in the grip of one of the worst storms of the winter. It\ntore up the lake and struck at the little house. The dark angry woods on the\nmainland scowled at Valancy, menace in the toss of their boughs, threats in\ntheir windy gloom, terror in the roar of their hearts. The trees on the island\ncrouched in fear. Valancy spent the night huddled on the rug before the fire,\nher face buried in her hands, when she was not vainly peering from the oriel in\na futile effort to see through the furious smoke of wind and snow that had once\nbeen blue-dimpled Mistawis. Where was Barney? Lost on the merciless lakes?\nSinking exhausted in the drifts of the pathless woods? Valancy died a hundred\ndeaths that night and paid in full for all the happiness of her Blue Castle.\nWhen morning came the storm broke and cleared; the sun shone gloriously over\nMistawis; and at noon Barney came home. Valancy saw him from the oriel as he\ncame around a wooded point, slender and black against the glistening white\nworld. She did not run to meet him. Something happened to her knees and she\ndropped down on Banjo\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds chair. Luckily Banjo got out from under in time, his\nwhiskers bristling with indignation.

            "One of the earliest signs of spring was the renaissance of Lady Jane. Barney\nput her on roads that no other car would look at, and they went through\nDeerwood in mud to the axles. They passed several Stirlings, who groaned and\nreflected that now spring was come they would encounter that shameless pair\neverywhere. Valancy, prowling about Deerwood shops, met Uncle Benjamin on the\nstreet; but he did not realise until he had gone two blocks further on that the\ngirl in the scarlet-collared blanket coat, with cheeks reddened in the sharp\nApril air and the fringe of black hair over laughing, slanted eyes, was\nValancy. When he did realise it, Uncle Benjamin was indignant. What business\nhad Valancy to look like\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlike\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlike a young girl? The way of the\ntransgressor was hard. Had to be. Scriptural and proper. Yet Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds path\ncouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be hard. She wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt look like that if it were. There was something\nwrong. It was almost enough to make a man turn modernist.",
            "Barney and Valancy clanged on to the Port, so that it was dark when they went\nthrough Deerwood again. At her old home Valancy, seized with a sudden impulse,\ngot out, opened the little gate and tiptoed around to the sitting-room window.\nThere sat her mother and Cousin Stickles drearily, grimly knitting. Baffling\nand inhuman as ever. If they had looked the least bit lonesome Valancy would\nhave gone in. But they did not. Valancy would not disturb them for worlds."

            "One day, coming home through the woods, with her arms full of trailing arbutus\nand creeping spruce, she met a man who she knew must be Allan Tierney. Allan\nTierney, the celebrated painter of beautiful women. He lived in New York in\nwinter, but he owned an island cottage at the northern end of Mistawis to which\nhe always came the minute the ice was out of the lake. He was reputed to be a\nlonely, eccentric man. He never flattered his sitters. There was no need to,\nfor he would not paint any one who required flattery. To be painted by Allan\nTierney was all the cachet of beauty a woman could desire. Valancy had\nheard so much about him that she couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt help turning her head back over her\nshoulder for another shy, curious look at him. A shaft of pale spring sunlight\nfell through a great pine athwart her bare black head and her slanted eyes. She\nwore a pale green sweater and had bound a fillet of linn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda vine about her hair.\nThe feathery fountain of trailing spruce overflowed her arms and fell around\nher. Allan Tierney\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds eyes lighted up.",

Q. E. D., Mistress Barney Snaith\nis a beautiful woman.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNonsense,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy, stooping to retrieve her arbutus. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou know\nthat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nonsense, Barney. I know I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm a heap better-looking than I was a year\nago, but I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not beautiful.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAllan Tierney never makes a mistake,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Barney. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou forget, Moonlight,\nthat there are different kinds of beauty. Your imagination is obsessed by the\nvery obvious type of your cousin Olive. Oh, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve seen her\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds a\nstunner\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdbut you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd never catch Allan Tierney wanting to paint her. In the\nhorrible but expressive slang phrase, she keeps all her goods in the\nshop-window. But in your subconscious mind you have a conviction that nobody\ncan be beautiful who doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt look like Olive. Also, you remember your face as\nit was in the days when your soul was not allowed to shine through it. Tierney\nsaid something about the curve of your cheek as you looked back over your\nshoulder. You know I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve often told you it was distracting. And he\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds quite batty\nabout your eyes. If I wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt absolutely sure it was solely\nprofessional\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds really a crabbed old bachelor, you know\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd be\njealous.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWell, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to be painted,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI hope you told him that.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt tell him that.

For of course I couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt buy the picture.\nSo even if you had wanted to be painted, Moonlight, your tyrannous husband\nwould not have permitted it. Tierney was a bit squiffy. He isn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt used to being\nturned down like that. His requests are almost like royalty\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBut we are outlaws,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd laughed Valancy. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe bow to no decrees\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwe\nacknowledge no sovereignty.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIn her heart she thought unashamedly:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI wish Olive could know that Allan Tierney wanted to paint me. Me!\nLittle-old-maid-Valancy-Stirling-that-was.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHer second wonder-moment came one evening in May. She realised that Barney\nactually liked her. She had always hoped he did, but sometimes she had a\nlittle, disagreeable, haunting dread that he was just kind and nice and chummy\nout of pity; knowing that she hadn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt long to live and determined she should\nhave a good time as long as she did live; but away back in his mind rather\nlooking forward to freedom again, with no intrusive woman creature in his\nisland fastness and no chattering thing beside him in his woodland prowls. She\nknew he could never love her. She did not even want him to. If he loved her he\nwould be unhappy when she died\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy never flinched from the plain\nword. No \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdpassing away\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd for her. And she did not want him to be the least\nunhappy. But neither did she want him to be glad\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor relieved. She wanted\nhim to like her and miss her as a good chum. But she had never been sure until\nthis night that he did.",

They had the delight of\ndiscovering a virgin spring in a ferny hollow and had drunk together from it\nout of a birch-bark cup; they had come to an old tumble-down rail fence and sat\non it for a long time. They didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt talk much, but Valancy had a curious sense\nof oneness. She knew that she couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have felt that if he hadn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt liked\nher.",

She had not been\ncareful\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe had never tried to be. But, somehow, she had always counted\non living out her year. She had not let herself think about it at all. But now,\nsitting here beside Barney, with her hand in his, a sudden realisation came to\nher. She had not had a heart attack for a long while\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtwo months at least.\nThe last one she had had was two or three nights before Barney was out in the\nstorm. Since then she had not remembered she had a heart. Well, no doubt, it\nbetokened the nearness of the end. Nature had given up the struggle. There\nwould be no more pain.",

Would that be\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnice? No, no. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\nwant to forget Barney. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd rather be miserable in heaven remembering him than\nhappy forgetting him.

            "They had gone around the lake one June evening in their disappearing propeller,\nfished for an hour in a little creek, left their boat there, and walked up\nthrough the woods to Port Lawrence two miles away. Valancy prowled a bit in the\nshops and got herself a new pair of sensible shoes. Her old pair had suddenly\nand completely given out, and this evening she had been compelled to put on the\nlittle fancy pair of patent-leather with rather high, slender heels, which she\nhad bought in a fit of folly one day in the winter because of their beauty and\nbecause she wanted to make one foolish, extravagant purchase in her life. She\nsometimes put them on of an evening in the Blue Castle, but this was the first\ntime she had worn them outside. She had not found it any too easy walking up\nthrough the woods in them, and Barney guyed her unmercifully about them. But in\nspite of the inconvenience, Valancy secretly rather liked the look of her trim\nankles and high instep above those pretty, foolish shoes and did not change\nthem in the shop as she might have done.",

Not a soul was in sight when Barney and Valancy emerged from the\nwoods. Off to the left a sudden curve in the track hid it from view, but over\nthe tree-tops beyond, the long plume of smoke betokened the approach of a\nthrough train. The rails were vibrating to its thunder as Barney stepped across\nthe switch. Valancy was a few steps behind him, loitering to gather June-bells\nalong the little, winding path.

She must know."

Well, well, it has agreed with\nyou. You don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt look much like an invalid now, hey? I remember that day. I was\nbadly upset. Hearing about poor Ned bowled me over.

And poor old\nMiss Sterling. She must have got your letter\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtelling her there was\nnothing serious the matter. Well, well, it couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have made any difference.\nHer case was hopeless. Nothing that she could have done or left undone could\nhave made any difference. I was surprised she lived as long as she\ndid\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdtwo months. She was here that day\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnot long before you. I hated\nto tell her the truth. You think I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm a blunt old curmudgeon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand my\nletters are blunt enough. I can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt soften things. But I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm a snivelling\ncoward when it comes to telling a woman face to face that she\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds got to die\nsoon. I told her I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd look up some features of the case I wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt quite sure of\nand let her know next day. But you got her letter\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlook here, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDear Miss\nS-t-e-r-l-i-n-g.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYes. I noticed that. But I thought it a mistake.

She died two months after she was here\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddied in her sleep. My\nmistake couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have made any difference to her. But you! I can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt forgive\nmyself for inflicting a year\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds misery on you. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds time I retired, all right,\nwhen I do things like that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdeven if my son was supposed to be fatally\ninjured. Can you ever forgive me?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdA year of misery! Valancy smiled a tortured smile as she thought of all the\nhappiness Dr. Trent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds mistake had bought her. But she was paying for it\nnow\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdoh, she was paying. If to feel was to live she was living with a\nvengeance.",
            "She let Dr. Trent examine her and answered all his questions. When he told her\nshe was fit as a fiddle and would probably live to be a hundred, she got up and\nwent away silently. She knew that there were a great many horrible things\noutside waiting to be thought over. Dr. Trent thought she was odd. Anybody\nwould have thought, from her hopeless eyes and woebegone face, that he had\ngiven her a sentence of death instead of life. Snaith? Snaith? Who the devil\nhad she married? He had never heard of Snaiths in Deerwood. And she had been\nsuch a sallow, faded, little old maid. Gad, but marriage had made a\ndifference in her, anyhow, whoever Snaith was. Snaith? Dr. Trent remembered.\nThat rapscallion \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdup back!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Had Valancy Stirling married him? And her\nclan had let her! Well, probably that solved the mystery. She had married in\nhaste and repented at leisure, and that was why she wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt overjoyed at\nlearning she was a good insurance prospect, after all. Married! To God knew\nwhom! Or what! Jail-bird? Defaulter? Fugitive from justice? It must be pretty\nbad if she had looked to death as a release, poor girl. But why were women such\nfools? Dr. Trent dismissed Valancy from his mind, though to the day of his\ndeath he was ashamed of putting those letters into the wrong envelopes."

            "CHAPTER XXXVIIIValancy walked quickly through the back streets\nand through Lover\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Lane. She did not want to meet any one she knew.

There was little fear of meeting any one she\nknew here. The cars that fled by her with raucous shrieks were filled with\nstrangers.

            "She had made a covenant with death and death had cheated her. Now life stood\nmocking her. She had trapped Barney. Trapped him into marrying her. And divorce\nwas so hard to get in Ontario. So expensive. And Barney was poor.",

            "She had had one draught from a divine cup and now it was dashed from her lips.\nWith no kind, friendly death to rescue her. She must go on living and longing\nfor it.

On the driver\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds seat sat a\nhaughty chauffeur in livery. And in the tonneau sat a man who opened the door\nand bounced out nimbly as Valancy came down the path to the landing-place.

A hatless man sprang from it and rushed up the steps. The bell was rung\nas it had never been rung before\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdvehemently, intensely. The ringer was\ndemanding entrance, not asking it. Uncle Benjamin chuckled as he hurried to the\ndoor. Uncle Benjamin had \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdjust dropped in\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd to enquire how dear\nDoss\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy was. Dear Doss\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy, he had been informed, was just\nthe same. She had come down for breakfast\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhich she didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt eat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgone\nback to her room, come down for dinner\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhich she didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt eat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgone\nback to her room. That was all. She had not talked. And she had been let,\nkindly, considerately, alone.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdVery good. Redfern will be here today,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Uncle Benjamin. And now Uncle\nBenjamin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds reputation as a prophet was made. Redfern was\nhere\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdunmistakably so.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIs my wife here?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he demanded of Uncle Benjamin without preface.",
            "Uncle Benjamin smiled expressively.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMr. Redfern, I believe? Very glad to meet you, sir. Yes, that naughty little\ngirl of yours is here. We have been\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI must see her,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Barney cut Uncle Benjamin ruthlessly short.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdCertainly, Mr. Redfern. Just step in here. Valancy will be down in a minute.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHe ushered Barney into the parlour and betook himself to the sitting-room and\nMrs. Frederick.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdGo up and tell Valancy to come down. Her husband is here.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBut so dubious was Uncle Benjamin as to whether Valancy could really come down\nin a minute\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor at all\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthat he followed Mrs. Frederick on tiptoe up\nthe stairs and listened in the hall.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy dear,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Mrs. Frederick tenderly, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyour husband is in the parlour,\nasking for you.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOh, Mother.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Valancy got up from the window and wrung her hands. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI cannot see\nhim\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI cannot! Tell him to go away\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdask him to go away. I\ncan\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt see him!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdTell her,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd hissed Uncle Benjamin through the keyhole, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthat Redfern says he\nwon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt go away until he has seen her.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRedfern had not said anything of the kind, but Uncle Benjamin thought he was\nthat sort of a fellow. Valancy knew he was. She understood that she might as\nwell go down first as last.",
            "She did not even look at Uncle Benjamin as she passed him on the landing. Uncle\nBenjamin did not mind. Rubbing his hands and chuckling, he retreated to the\nkitchen, where he genially demanded of Cousin Stickles:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhy are good husbands like bread?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdCousin Stickles asked why.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBecause women need them,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd beamed Uncle Benjamin.",
            "Valancy was looking anything but beautiful when she entered the parlour. Her\nwhite night had played fearful havoc with her face. She wore an ugly old\nbrown-and-blue gingham, having left all her pretty dresses in the Blue Castle.\nBut Barney dashed across the room and caught her in his arms.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy, darling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdoh, you darling little idiot! Whatever possessed you to\nrun away like that? When I came home last night and found your letter I went\nquite mad. It was twelve o\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdclock\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI knew it was too late to come here\nthen. I walked the floor all night. Then this morning Dad came\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\nget away till now. Valancy, whatever got into you? Divorce, forsooth! Don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt you\nknow\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI know you only married me out of pity,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy, brushing him away\nfeebly. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI know you don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt love me\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI know\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been lying awake at three o\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdclock too long,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Barney, shaking her.\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds all that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the matter with you. Love you! Oh, don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt I love you! My\ngirl, when I saw that train coming down on you I knew whether I loved you or\nnot!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOh, I was afraid you would try to make me think you cared,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd cried Valancy\npassionately. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddon\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt! I know. I know all about Ethel\nTraverse\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyour father told me everything. Oh, Barney, don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt torture me! I\ncan never go back to you!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBarney released her and looked at her for a moment. Something in her pallid,\nresolute face spoke more convincingly than words of her determination.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said quietly, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdFather couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have told you everything because\nhe didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt know it. Will you let me tell you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdeverything?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYes,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Valancy wearily. Oh, how dear he was! How she longed to throw\nherself into his arms! As he put her gently down in a chair, she could have\nkissed the slender, brown hands that touched her arms. She could not look up as\nhe stood before her. She dared not meet his eyes. For his sake, she must be\nbrave. She knew him\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdkind, unselfish. Of course he would pretend he did\nnot want his freedom\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdshe might have known he would pretend that, once the\nfirst shock of realisation was over. He was so sorry for her\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdhe\nunderstood her terrible position. When had he ever failed to understand? But\nshe would never accept his sacrifice. Never!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve seen Dad and you know I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm Bernard Redfern. And I suppose you\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve guessed\nthat I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm John Foster\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsince you went into Bluebeard\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Chamber.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYes. But I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt go in out of curiosity. I forgot you had told me not to go\nin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI forgot\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdNever mind. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm not going to kill you and hang you up on the wall, so there\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds\nno need to call for Sister Anne. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm only going to tell you my story from the\nbeginning. I came back last night intending to do it. Yes, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdold Doc.\nRedfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds son\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdof Purple Pills and Bitters fame. Oh, don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt I know it?\nWasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt it rubbed into me for years?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBarney laughed bitterly and strode up and down the room a few times. Uncle\nBenjamin, tiptoeing through the hall, heard the laugh and frowned. Surely Doss\nwasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt going to be a stubborn little fool. Barney threw himself into a chair\nbefore Valancy.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYes. As long as I can remember I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdve been a millionaire\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds son. But when I was\nborn Dad wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt a millionaire. He wasn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt even a doctor\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdisn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt yet. He was\na veterinary and a failure at it. He and Mother lived in a little village up in\nQuebec and were abominably poor. I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt remember Mother. Haven\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt even a\npicture of her. She died when I was two years old. She was fifteen years\nyounger than Father\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda little school teacher. When she died Dad moved into\nMontreal and formed a company to sell his hair tonic. He\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd dreamed the\nprescription one night, it seems. Well, it caught on. Money began to flow in.\nDad invented\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor dreamed\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe other things, too\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdPills, Bitters,\nLiniment and so on. He was a millionaire by the time I was ten, with a house so\nbig a small chap like myself always felt lost in it. I had every toy a boy\ncould wish for\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand I was the loneliest little devil in the world. I\nremember only one happy day in my childhood, Valancy. Only one. Even you were\nbetter off than that. Dad had gone out to see an old friend in the country and\ntook me along. I was turned loose in the barnyard and I spent the whole day\nhammering nails in a block of wood. I had a glorious day. When I had to go back\nto my roomful of playthings in the big house in Montreal I cried. But I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\ntell Dad why. I never told him anything. It\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds always been a hard thing for me\nto tell things, Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdanything that went deep. And most things went\ndeep with me. I was a sensitive child and I was even more sensitive as a boy.\nNo one ever knew what I suffered. Dad never dreamed of it.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWhen he sent me to a private school\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI was only eleven\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe boys\nducked me in the swimming-tank until I stood on a table and read aloud all the\nadvertisements of Father\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds patent abominations. I did\nit\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBarney clinched his fists\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI was frightened and half\ndrowned and all my world was against me. But when I went to college and the\nsophs tried the same stunt I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt do it.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Barney smiled grimly. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThey\ncouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt make me do it. But they could\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand did\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdmake my life\nmiserable. I never heard the last of the Pills and the Bitters and the Hair\nTonic. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAfter using\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd was my nickname\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyou see I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd always such a thick\nthatch. My four college years were a nightmare. You know\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor you don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt\nknow\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwhat merciless beasts boys can be when they get a victim like me. I\nhad few friends\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthere was always some barrier between me and the kind of\npeople I cared for. And the other kind\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwho would have been very willing\nto be intimate with rich old Doc. Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds son\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care for. But I\nhad one friend\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor thought I had. A clever, bookish chap\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda bit of a\nwriter. That was a bond between us\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI had some secret aspirations along\nthat line. He was older than I was\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI looked up to him and worshipped him.\nFor a year I was happier than I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd ever been. Then\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda burlesque sketch came\nout in the college magazine\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda mordant thing, ridiculing Dad\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds remedies.\nThe names were changed, of course, but everybody knew what and who was meant.\nOh, it was clever\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddamnably so\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand witty. McGill rocked with\nlaughter over it. I found out he had written it.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOh, were you sure?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Valancy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds dull eyes flamed with indignation.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYes. He admitted it when I asked him. Said a good idea was worth more to him\nthan a friend, any time. And he added a gratuitous thrust. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdYou know, Redfern,\nthere are some things money won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt buy. For instance\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdit won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt buy you a\ngrandfather.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Well, it was a nasty slam. I was young enough to feel cut up. And\nit destroyed a lot of my ideals and illusions, which was the worst thing about\nit. I was a young misanthrope after that. Didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt want to be friends with any\none. And then\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe year after I left college\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI met Ethel Traverse.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdValancy shivered. Barney, his hands stuck in his pockets, was regarding the\nfloor moodily and didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt notice it.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDad told you about her, I suppose. She was very beautiful. And I loved her.\nOh, yes, I loved her. I won\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt deny it or belittle it now. It was a lonely,\nromantic boy\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds first passionate love, and it was very real. And I thought she\nloved me. I was fool enough to think that. I was wildly happy when she promised\nto marry me. For a few months. Then\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI found out she didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt. I was an\ninvoluntary eavesdropper on a certain occasion for a moment. That moment was\nenough. The proverbial fate of the eavesdropper overtook me. A girl friend of\nhers was asking her how she could stomach Doc. Redfern\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds son and the\npatent-medicine background.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdHis money will gild the Pills and sweeten the Bitters,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Ethel, with a\nlaugh. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMother told me to catch him if I could. We\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdre on the rocks. But pah! I\nsmell turpentine whenever he comes near me.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOh, Barney!\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd cried Valancy, wrung with pity for him. She had forgotten all\nabout herself and was filled with compassion for Barney and rage against Ethel\nTraverse. How dared she?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWell,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBarney got up and began pacing round the room\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthat\nfinished me. Completely. I left civilisation and those accursed dopes behind me\nand went to the Yukon. For five years I knocked about the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdin all\nsorts of outlandish places. I earned enough to live on\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI wouldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt touch a\ncent of Dad\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds money. Then one day I woke up to the fact that I no longer cared\na hang about Ethel, one way or another. She was somebody I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd known in another\nworld\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthat was all. But I had no hankering to go back to the old life.\nNone of that for me. I was free and I meant to keep so. I came to\nMistawis\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsaw Tom MacMurray\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds island. My first book had been published the\nyear before, and made a hit\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI had a bit of money from my royalties. I\nbought my island. But I kept away from people. I had no faith in anybody. I\ndidn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt believe there was such a thing as real friendship or true love in the\nworld\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnot for me, anyhow\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdthe son of Purple Pills. I used to revel\nin all the wild yarns they told of me. In fact, I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdm afraid I suggested a few of\nthem myself. By mysterious remarks which people interpreted in the light of\ntheir own prepossessions.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdyou came. I had to believe you loved me\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdreally loved\nme\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnot my father\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds millions. There was no other reason why you\nshould want to marry a penniless devil with my supposed record. And I was sorry\nfor you. Oh, yes, I don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt deny I married you because I was sorry for you. And\nthen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI found you the best and jolliest and dearest little pal and chum a\nfellow ever had. Witty\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdloyal\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdsweet. You made me believe again in\nthe reality of friendship and love. The world seemed good again just because\nyou were in it, honey. I\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdd have been willing to go on forever just as we were.\nI knew that, the night I came home and saw my homelight shining out from the\nisland for the first time. And knew you were there waiting for me. After being\nhomeless all my life it was beautiful to have a home. To come home hungry at\nnight and know there was a good supper and a cheery fire\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand you.",
            "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdBut I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt realise what you actually meant to me till that moment at the\nswitch. Then it came like a lightning flash.

I felt sure you couldn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt be as bad as Dr. Trent\nthought, when those moments on the track hadn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt even hurt you. And I found your\nnote\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand went mad with happiness\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdand a little terror for fear you\ndidn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt care much for me, after all, and had gone away to get rid of me. But\nnow, it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds all right, isn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt it, darling?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWas she, Valancy being called \u00ef\u00bf\u00bddarling\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd?\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt believe you care for me,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she said helplessly. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdI know\nyou can\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt.
