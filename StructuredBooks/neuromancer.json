{"content": {"1": ["The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned\nto a dead channel.\n\"It's not like I'm using,\" Case heard someone say, as he\nshouldered his way through the crowd around the door of the\nChat. \"It's like my body's developed this massive drug defi-\nciency.\" It was a Sprawl voice and a Sprawl joke. The Chatsubo\nwas a bar for professional expatriates; you could drink there\nfor a week and never hear two words in Japanese.\nRatz was tending bar, his prosthetic arm jerking monoto-\nnously as he filled a tray of glasses with draft Kirin. He saw\nCase and smiled, his teeth a web work of East European steel\nand brown decay. Case found a place at the bar, between the\nunlikely tan on one of Lonny Zone's whores and the crisp naval\nuniform of a tall African whose cheekbones were ridged with\nprecise rows of tribal scars. \"Wage was in here early, with two\nJoe boys,\" Ratz said, shoving a draft across the bar with his\ngood hand. \"Maybe some business with you, Case?\"\nCase shrugged. The girl to his right giggled and nudged\nhim.\nThe bartender's smile widened. His ugliness was the stuff\nof legend. In an age of affordable beauty, there was something\nheraldic about his lack of it. The antique arm whined as he\nreached for another mug. It was a Russian military prosthesis,\na seven-function force-feedback manipulator, cased in grubby\npink plastic. \"You are too much the artiste, Herr Case.\" Ratz\ngrunted; the sound served him as laughter. He scratched his\noverhang of white-shirted belly with the pink claw. \"You are\nthe artiste of the slightly funny deal.\"\n\"Sure,\" Case said, and sipped his beer. \"Somebody's gotta\nbe funny around here. Sure the fuck isn't you.\"\nThe whore's giggle went up an octave.\n\"Isn't you either, sister. So you vanish, okay? Zone, he's\na close personal friend of mine.\"\nShe looked Case in the eye and made the softest possible\nspitting sound, her lips barely moving. But she left.\n\"Jesus,\" Case said, \"what kind a creep joint you running here?\nMan can't have a drink.\"\n\"Ha,\" Ratz said, swabbing the scarred wood with a rag,\n\"Zone shows a percentage. You I let work here for entertain-\nment value.\"\nAs Case was picking up his beer, one of those strange\ninstants of silence descended, as though a hundred unrelated\nconversations had simultaneously arrived at the same pause.\nThen the whore's giggle rang out, tinged with a certain hysteria.\nRatz grunted. \"An angel passed.\"\n\"The Chinese,\" bellowed a drunken Australian, \"Chinese\nbloody invented nerve-splicing. Give me the mainland for a\nnerve job any day. Fix you right, mate....\"\n\"Now that,\" Case said to his glass, all his bitterness suddenly\nrising in him like bile, \"that is so much bullshit.\"", "The Japanese had already forgotten more neurosurgery than\nthe Chinese had ever known. The black clinics of Chiba were\nthe cutting edge, whole bodies of technique supplanted monthly,\nand still they couldn't repair the damage he'd suffered in that\nMemphis hotel.\nA year here and he still dreamed of cyberspace, hope fading\nnightly. All the speed he took, all the turns he'd taken and the\ncorners he'd cut in Night City, and still he'd see the matrix in\nhis sleep, bright lattices of logic unfolding across that colorless\nvoid.... The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the\nPacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cow-\nboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the\ndreams came on in the Japanese night like live wire voodoo\nand he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the\ndark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands\nclawed into the bedslab, temper foam bunched between his fin-\ngers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there.", "\"I saw your girl last night,\" Ratz said, passing Case his\nsecond Kirin.\n\"I don't have one,\" he said, and drank.\n\"Miss Linda Lee.\"\nCase shook his head.\n\"No girl? Nothing? Only biz, friend artiste? Dedication to\ncommerce?\" The bartender's small brown eyes were nested\ndeep in wrinkled flesh. \"I think I liked you better, with her.\nYou laughed more. Now, some night, you get maybe too ar-\ntistic, you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.\"\n\"You're breaking my heart, Ratz.\" He finished his beer,\npaid and left, high narrow shoulders hunched beneath the rain-\n stained khaki nylon of his windbreaker. Threading his way\nthrough the Ninsei crowds, he could smell his own stale sweat.", "Case was twenty-four. At twenty-two, he'd been a cowboy\na rustler, one of the best in the Sprawl. He'd been trained by\nthe best, by McCoy Pauley and Bobby Quine, legends in the\nbiz. He'd operated on an almost permanent adrenaline high, a\nbyproduct of youth and proficiency, jacked into a custom cy-\nberspace deck that projected his disembodied consciousness\ninto the con sensual hallucination that was the matrix. A thief\nhe'd worked for other, wealthier thieves, employers who pro-\nvided the exotic software required to penetrate the bright walls\nof corporate systems, opening windows into rich fields of data.\nHe'd made the classic mistake, the one he'd sworn he'd\nnever make. He stole from his employers. He kept something\nfor himself and tried to move it through a fence in Amsterdam.\nHe still wasn't sure how he'd been discovered, not that it\nmattered now. He'd expected to die, then, but they only smiled.\nOf course he was welcome, they told him, welcome to the\nmoney. And he was going to need it. Because--still smiling--\nthey were going to make sure he never worked again.\nThey damaged his nervous system with a wartime Russian\nmycotoxin.\nStrapped to a bed in a Memphis hotel, his talent burning\nout micron by micron, he hallucinated for thirty hours.\nThe damage was minute, subtle, and utterly effective.\nFor Case, who'd lived for the bodiless exultation of cyber-\nspace, it was the Fall. In the bars he'd frequented as a cowboy\nhotshot, the elite stance involved a certain relaxed contempt\nfor the flesh. The body was meat. Case fell into the prison of\nhis own flesh.", "His total assets were quickly converted to New Yen, a fat\nsheaf of the old paper currency that circulated endlessly through\nthe closed circuit of the world's black markets like the seashells\nof the Trobriand islanders. It was difficult to transact legitimate\nbusiness with cash in the Sprawl; in Japan, it was already\nillegal.\nIn Japan, he'd known with a clenched and absolute certainty,\nhe'd find his cure. In Chiba. Either in a registered clinic or in\nthe shadow land of black medicine. Synonymous with implants,\nnerve-splicing, and micro bionics, Chiba was a magnet for the\nSprawl's techno-criminal subcultures.\nIn Chiba, he'd watched his New Yen vanish in a two-month\nround of examinations and consultations. The men in the black\nclinics, his last hope, had admired the expertise with which\nhe'd been maimed, and then slowly shaken their heads.\nNow he slept in the cheapest coffins, the ones nearest the\nport, beneath the quartz-halogen floods that lit the docks all\nnight like vast stages; where you couldn't see the lights of\nTokyo for the glare of the television sky, not even the towering\nhologram logo of the Fuji Electric Company, and Tokyo Bay\nwas a black expanse where gulls wheeled above drifting shoals\nof white styrofoam. Behind the port lay the city, factory domes\ndominated by the vast cubes of corporate arcologies. Port and\ncity were divided by a narrow borderland of older streets, an\narea with no official name. Night City, with Ninsei its heart.\nBy day, the bars down Ninsei were shuttered and featureless,\nthe neon dead, the holograms inert, waiting, under the poisoned\nsilver sky.", "Two blocks west of the Chat, in a teashop called the Jarre\nde The, Case washed down the night's first pill with a double\nespresso. It was a flat pink octagon, a potent species of Bra-\nzilian dex he bought from one of Zone's girls.\nThe Jarre was walled with mirrors, each panel framed in\nred neon.\nAt first, finding himself alone in Chiba, with little money\nand less hope of finding a cure, he'd gone into a kind of terminal\noverdrive, hustling fresh capital with a cold intensity that had\nseemed to belong to someone else. In the first month, he'd\nkilled two men and a woman over sums that a year before\nwould have seemed ludicrous. Ninsei wore him down until the\nstreet itself came to seem the externalization of some death\nwish, some secret poison he hadn't known he carried.\nNight City was like a deranged experiment in social Dar-\nwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb\npermanently on the fast-forward button. Stop hustling and you\nsank without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you'd\nbreak the fragile surface tension of the black market; either\nway, you were gone, with nothing left of you but some vague\nmemory in the mind of a fixture like Ratz, though heart or\nlungs or kidneys might survive in the service of some stranger\nwith New Yen for the clinic tanks.\nBiz here was a constant subliminal hum, and death the\naccepted punishment for laziness, carelessness, lack of grace,\nthe failure to heed the demands of an intricate protocol.\nAlone at a table in the Jarre de The, with the octagon coming\non, pinheads of sweat starting from his palms, suddenly aware\nof each tingling hair on his arms and chest, Case knew that at\nsome point he'd started to play a game with himself, a very\nancient one that has no name, a final solitaire. He no longer\ncarried a weapon, no longer took the basic precautions. He ran\nthe fastest, loosest deals on the street, and he had a reputation\nfor being able to get whatever you wanted. A part of him knew\nthat the arc of his self-destruction was glaringly obvious to his\ncustomers, who grew steadily fewer, but that same part of him\nbasked in the knowledge that it was only a matter of time. And\nthat was the part of him, smug in its expectation of death, that\nmost hated the thought of Linda Lee.\nHe'd found her, one rainy night, in an arcade.\nUnder bright ghosts burning through a blue haze of cigar-\nette smoke, holograms of Wizard's Castle, Tank War Europa,\nthe New York skyline.... And now he remembered her that\nway, her face bathed in restless laser light, features reduced to\na code: her cheekbones flaring scarlet as Wizard's Castle burned,\nforehead drenched with azure when Munich fell to the Tank\nWar, mouth touched with hot gold as a gliding cursor struck\nsparks from the wall of a skyscraper canyon. He was riding\nhigh that night, with a brick of Wage's ketamine on its way\nto Yokohama and the money already in his pocket. He'd come\nin out of the warm rain that sizzled across the Ninsei pavement\nand somehow she'd been singled out for him, one face out of\nthe dozens who stood at the consoles, lost in the game she\nplayed. The expression on her face, then, had been the one\nhe'd seen, hours later, on her sleeping face in a port side coffin,\nher upper lip like the line children draw to represent a bird in\nflight.\nCrossing the arcade to stand beside her, high on the deal\nhe'd made, he saw her glance up. Gray eyes rimmed with\nsmudged black paintstick. Eyes of some animal pinned in the\nheadlights of an oncoming vehicle.\nTheir night together stretching into a morning, into tickets\nat the hover port and his first trip across the Bay. The rain kept\nup, falling along Harajuku, beading on her plastic jacket, the\nchildren of Tokyo trooping past the famous boutiques in white\nloafers and cling wrap capes, until she'd stood with him in the\nmidnight clatter of a pachinko parlor and held his hand like a\nchild.\nIt took a month for the gestalt of drugs and tension he moved\nthrough to turn those perpetually startled eyes into wells of\nreflexive need. He'd watched her personality fragment, calving\nlike an iceberg, splinters drifting away, and finally he'd seen\nthe raw need, the hungry armature of addiction. He'd watched\nher track the next hit with a concentration that reminded him\nof the mantises they sold in stalls along Shiga, beside tanks of\nblue mutant carp and crickets caged in bamboo.\nHe stared at the black ring of grounds in his empty cup. It\nwas vibrating with the speed he'd taken. The brown laminate\nof the table top was dull with a patina of tiny scratches. With\nthe dex mounting through his spine he saw the countless random\nimpacts required to create a surface like that. The Jarre was\ndecorated in a dated, nameless style from the previous century,\nan uneasy blend of Japanese traditional and pale Milanese plas-\ntics, but everything seemed to wear a subtle film, as though\nthe bad nerves of a million customers had somehow attacked\nthe mirrors and the once glossy plastics, leaving each surface\nfogged with something that could never be wiped away.\n\"Hey. Case, good buddy....\"\nHe looked up, met gray eyes ringed with paintstick. She\nwas wearing faded French orbital fatigues and new white sneak-\ners.\n\"I been lookin' for you, man.\" She took a seat opposite\nhim, her elbows on the table. The sleeves of the blue zip suit\nhad been ripped out at the shoulders; he automatically checked\nher arms for signs of terms or the needle. \"Want a cigarette?\"\nShe dug a crumpled pack of Yeheyuan filters from an ankle\npocket and offered him one. He took it, let her light it with a\nred plastic tube. \"You sleep in' okay, Case? You look tired.\"\nHer accent put her south along the Sprawl, toward Atlanta.\nThe skin below her eyes was pale and unhealthy-looking, but\nthe flesh was still smooth and firm. She was twenty. New lines\nof pain were starting to etch themselves permanently at the\ncorners of her mouth. Her dark hair was drawn back, held by\na band of printed silk. The pattern might have represented\nmicrocircuits, or a city map.\n\"Not if I remember to take my pills,\" he said, as a tangible\nwave of longing hit him, lust and loneliness riding in on the\nwavelength of amphetamine. He remembered the smell of her\nskin in the overheated darkness of a coffin near the port, her\nlocked across the small of his back.\nAll the meat, he thought, and all it wants.\n\"Wage,\" she said, narrowing her eyes. \"He wants to see\nyou with a hole in your face.\" She lit her own cigarette.\n\"Who says? Ratz? You been talking to Ratz?\"\n\"No. Mona. Her new squeeze is one of Wage's boys.\"\n\"I don't owe him enough. He does me, he's out the money\nanyway.\" He shrugged.\n\"Too many people owe him now, Case. Maybe you get to\nbe the example. You seriously better watch it.\"\n\"Sure. How about you, Linda? You got anywhere to sleep?\"\n\"Sleep.\" She shook her head. \"Sure, Case.\" She shivered,\nhunched forward over the table. Her face was filmed with\nsweat.\n\"Here,\" he said, and dug in the pocket of his windbreaker,\ncoming up with a crumpled fifty. He smoothed it automatically,\nunder the table, folded it in quarters, and passed it to her.\n\"You need that, honey. You better give it to Wage.\" There\nwas something in the gray eyes now that he couldn't read,\nsomething he'd never seen there before.\n\"I owe Wage a lot more than that. Take it. I got more\ncoming,\" he lied, as he watched his New Yen vanish into a\nzippered pocket.\n\"You get your money, Case, you find Wage quick.\"\n\"I'll see you, Linda,\" he said, getting up.\n\"Sure.\" A millimeter of white showed beneath each of her\npupils. Sanpaku. \"You watch your back, man.\"\nHe nodded, anxious to be gone.\nHe looked back as the plastic door swung shut behind him,\nsaw her eyes reflected in a cage of red neon.", "Friday night on Ninsei.\nHe passed yakitori stands and massage parlors, a franchised\ncoffee shop called Beautiful Girl, the electronic thunder of an\narcade. He stepped out of the way to let a dark-suited sarariman\nby, spotting the Mitsubishi-Genentech logo tattooed across the\nback of the man's right hand.\nWas it authentic? lf that's for real, he thought, he's in for\ntrouble. If it wasn't, served him right. M-G employees above\na certain level were implanted with advanced microprocessors\nthat monitored mutagen levels in the bloodstream. Gear like\nthat would get you rolled in Night City, rolled straight into a\nblack clinic.\nThe sarariman had been Japanese, but the Ninsei crowd was\na gaijin crowd. Groups of sailors up from the port, tense solitary\ntourists hunting pleasures no guidebook listed, Sprawl heavies\nshowing off grafts and implants, and a dozen distinct species.\nof hustler, all swarming the street in an intricate dance of desire\nand commerce.\nThere were countless theories explaining why Chiba City\ntolerated the Ninsei enclave, but Case tended toward the idea\nthat the Yakuza might be preserving the place as a kind of\nhistorical park, a reminder of humble origins. But he also\nsaw a certain sense in the notion that burgeoning technologies\nrequire outlaw zones, that Night City wasn't there for its in-\nhabitants, but as a deliberately unsupervised playground for\ntechnology itself.\nWas Linda right, he wondered, staring up at the lights?\nWould Wage have him killed to make an example? It didn't\nmake much sense, but then Wage dealt primarily in proscribed\nbiologicals, and they said you had to be crazy to do that.\nBut Linda said Wage wanted him dead. Case's primary\ninsight into the dynamics of street dealing was that neither the\nbuyer nor the seller really needed him. A middleman's business\nis to make himself a necessary evil. The dubious niche Case\nhad carved for himself in the criminal ecology of Night City\nhad beep cut out with lies, scooped out a night at a time with\nbetrayal. Now, sensing that its walls were starting to crumble,\nhe felt the edge of a strange euphoria.\nThe week before, he'd delayed transfer of a synthetic glan-\ndular extract, retailing it for a wider margin than usual. He\nknew Wage hadn't liked that. Wage was his primary supplier,\nnine years in Chiba and one of the few gaijin dealers who'd\nMao aged to forge links with the rigidly strati fled criminal es-\ntablishment beyond Night City's borders. Genetic materials and\nhormones trickled down to Ninsei along an intricate ladder of\nfronts and blinds. Somehow Wage had managed to trace some-\nthing back, once, and now he enjoyed steady connections in a\ndozen cities.\nCase found himself staring through a shop window. The\nplace sold small bright objects to the sailors. Watches, flic-\nknives, lighters, pocket VTRs, Sims Tim decks, weighted man-\nriki chains, and shuriken. The shuriken had always fascinated\nhim, steel stars with knife-sharp points. Some were chromed,\nothers black, others treated with a rainbow surface like oil on\nwater. But the chrome stars held his gaze. They were mounted\nagainst scarlet ultra suede with nearly invisible loops of nylon\nfish line, their centers stamped with dragons or yin yang sym-\nbols. They caught the street's neon and twisted it, and it came\nto Case that these were the stars under which he voyaged, his\ndestiny spelled out in a constellation of cheap chrome.\n\"Julie,\" he said to his stars. \"Time to see old Julie. He'll\nknow.\"", "Julius Deane was one hundred and thirty-five years old, his\nmetabolism assiduously warped by a weekly fortune in serums\nand hormones. His primary hedge against aging was a yearly\npilgrimage to Tokyo, where genetic surgeons re-set the code\nof his DNA, a procedure unavailable in Chiba. Then he'd fly\nto Hongkong and order the year's suits and shirts. Sexless and\ninhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to lie in\nhis devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship. Case had never\nseen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe\nseemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstructions of gar-\nments of the previous century. He affected prescription lenses,\nframed in spidery gold, ground from thin slabs of pink synthetic\nquartz and beveled like the mirrors in a Victorian doll house.\nHis offices were located in a warehouse behind Ninsei, part\nof which seemed to have been sparsely decorated, years before,\nwith a random collection of European furniture, as though\nDeane had once intended to use the place as his home. Neo-\nAztec bookcases gathered dust against one wall of the room\nwhere Case waited. A pair of bulbous Disney-styled table lamps\nperched awkwardly on a low Kandinsky-look coffee table in\nscarlet-lacquered steel. A Dali clock hung on the wall between\nthe bookcases, its distorted face sagging to the bare concrete\nfloor. Its hands were holograms that altered to match the con-\nvolutions of the face as they rotated, but it never told the correct\ntime. The room was stacked with white fiberglass shipping\nmodules that gave off the tang of preserved ginger.\n\"You seem to be clean, old son,\" said Deane's disembodied\nvoice. \"Do come in.\"\nMagnetic bolts thudded out of position around the massive\nimitation-rosewood door to the left of the bookcases. JULIUS\nDEANE IMPORT EXPORT was lettered across the plastic in\npeeling self-adhesive capitals. If the furniture scattered in\nDeane's makeshift foyer suggested the end of the past century,\nthe office itself seemed to belong to its start.\nDeane's seamless pink face regarded Case from a pool of\nlight cast by an ancient brass lamp with a rectangular shade of\ndark green glass. The importer was securely fenced behind a\nvast desk of painted steel, flanked on either side by tall, draw-\ner Ed cabinets made of some sort of pale wood. The sort of\nthing, Case supposed, that had once been used to store written\nrecords of some kind. The desktop was littered with cassettes,\nscrolls of yellowed printout, and various parts of some sort of\nclockwork typewriter, a machine Deane never seemed to get\naround to reassembling.\n\"What brings you around, boyo?\" Deane asked, offering\nCase a narrow bonbon wrapped in blue-and-white checked pa-\nper. \"Try one. Tins Ting Djahe, the very best.\" Case refused\nthe ginger, took a seat in a yawing wooden swivel chair, and\nran a thumb down the faded seam of one black jeans-leg. \"Julie\nI hear Wage wants to kill me.\"\n\"Ah. Well then. And where did you hear this, if I may?\"\n\"People.\"\n\"People,\" Deane said, around a ginger bonbon. \"What sort\nof people? Friends?\"\nCase nodded.\n\"Not always that easy to know who your friends are, is it?\"\n\"I do owe him a little money, Deane. He say anything to\nyou?\"\n\"Haven't been in touch, of late.\" Then he sighed. \"If I did\nknow, of course, I might not be in a position to tell you. Things\nbeing what they are, you understand.\"\n\"Things?\"\n\"He's an important connection Case.\"\n\"Yeah. He want to kill me, Juiie?\"\n\"Not that I know of.\" Deane shrugged. They might have\nbeen discussing the price of ginger. \"If it proves to be an\nunfounded rumor, old son, you come back in a week or so and\nI'll let you in on a little something out of Singapore.\"\n\"Out of the Nan Hai Hotel, Bencoolen Street?\"\n\"Loose lips, old son!\" Deane grinned. The steel desk was\njammed with a fortune in debugging gear.\n\"Be seeing you, Julie. I'll say hello to Wage.\"\nDeane's fingers came up to brush the perfect knot in his\npale silk tie.", "He was less than a block from Deane's office when it hit,\nthe sudden cellular awareness that someone was on his ass,\nand very close.\nThe cultivation of a certain tame paranoia was something\nCase took for granted. The trick lay in not letting it get out of\ncontrol. But that could be quite a trick, behind a stack of\noctagons. He fought the adrenaline surge and composed his\nnarrow features in a mask of bored vacancy, pretending to let\nthe crowd carry him along. When he saw a darkened display\nwindow, he managed to pause by it. The place was a surgical\nboutique, closed for renovations. With his hands in the pockets\nof his jacket, he stared through the glass at a flat lozenge of\nvat grown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of imitation jade.\nThe color of its skin reminded him of Zone's whores; it was\ntattooed with a luminous digital display wired to a subcutaneous\nchip. Why bother with the surgery, he found himself thinking,\nwhile sweat coursed down his ribs, when you could just carry\nthe thing around in your pocket?\nWithout moving his head, he raised his eyes and studied\nthe reflection of the passing crowd.\nThere.\nBehind sailors in short-sleeved khaki. Dark hair, mirrored\nglasses, dark clothing, slender. . .\nAnd gone.\nThen Case was running, bent low, dodging between bodies.", "\"Rent me a gun, Shin?\"\nThe boy smiled. \"Two hour.\" They stood together in the\nsmell of fresh raw seafood at the rear of a Shiga sushi stall.\n\"You come back, two hour.\"\n\"I need one now, man. Got anything right now?\"\nShin rummaged behind empty two-liter cans that had once\nbeen filled with powdered horseradish. He produced a slender\npackage wrapped in gray plastic. \"Taser. One hour, twenty\nNew Yen. Thirty deposit.\"\n\"Shit. I don't need that. I need a gun. Like I maybe wanna\nshoot somebody, understand?\"\nThe waiter shrugged, replacing the taser behind the horse-\nradish cans. \"Two hour.\"", "He went into the shop without bothering to glance at the\ndisplay of shuriken. He'd never thrown one in his life.\nHe bought two packs of Yeheyuans with a Mitsubishi Bank\nchip that gave his name as Charles Derek May. It beat Truman\nStarr, the best he'd been able to do for a passport.\nThe Japanese woman behind the terminal looked like she\nhad a few years on old Deane, none of them with the benefit\nof science. He took his slender roll of New Yen out of his\npocket and showed it to her. \"I want to buy a weapon.\"\nShe gestured in the direction of a case filled with knives.\n\"No,\" he said, \"I don't like knives.\"\nShe brought an oblong box from beneath the counter. The\nlid was yellow cardboard, stamped with a crude image of a\ncoiled cobra with a swollen hood. Inside were eight identical\ntissue-wrapped cylinders. He watched while mottled brown\nfingers stripped the paper from one. She held the thing up for\nhim to examine, a dull steel tube with a leather thong at one\nend and a small bronze pyramid at the other. She gripped the\ntube with one hand, the pyramid between her other thumb and\nforefinger, and pulled. Three oiled, telescoping segments of\ntightly wound coil spring slid out and locked. \"Cobra,\" she said.", "Beyond the neon shudder of Ninsei, the sky was that mean\nshade of gray. The air had gotten worse; it seemed to have\nteeth tonight, and half the crowd wore filtration masks. Case\nhad spent ten minutes in a urinal, trying to discover a convenient\nway to conceal his cobra; finally he'd settled for tucking the\nhandle into the waistband of his jeans, with the tube slanting\nacross his stomach. The pyramidal striking tip rode between\nhis ribcage and the lining of his windbreaker. The thing felt\nlike it might clatter to the pavement with his next step, but it\nmade him feel better.\nThe Chat wasn't really a dealing bar, but on weeknights it\nattracted a related clientele. Fridays and Saturdays were dif-\nferent. The regulars were still there, most of them, but they\nfaded behind an influx of sailors and the specialists who preyed\non diem. As Case pushed through the doors, he looked for\nRatz, but the bartender wasn't in sight. Lonny Zone, the bar's\nresident pimp, was observing with glazed fatherly interest as\none of his girls went to work on a young sailor. Zone was\naddicted to a brand of hypnotic the Japanese called Cloud\nDancers. Catching the pimp's eye, Case beckoned him to the\nbar. Zone came drifting through the crowd in slow motion, his\nlong face slack and placid.\n\"You seen Wage tonight, Lonny?\"\nZone regarded him with his usual calm. He shook his head.\n\"You sure, man?\"\n\"Maybe in the Namban. Maybe two hours ago.\"\n\"Got some Joeboys with him? One of 'em thin, dark hair,\nmaybe a black jacket?\"\n\"No,\" Zone said at last, his smooth forehead creased to\nindicate the effort it cost him to recall so much pointless detail.\n\"Big boys. Graftees.\" Zone's eyes showed very little white and\nless iris; under the drooping lids, his pupils were dilated and\nenormous. He stared into Case's face for a long time, then\nlowered his gaze. He saw the bulge of the steel whip. \"Cobra,\"\nhe said, and raised an eyebrow. \"You wanna fuck somebody\nup?\"", "\"See you, Lonny.\" Case left the bar.", "His tail was back. He was sure of it. He felt a stab of elation\nthe octagons and adrenaline mingling with something else.\nYou're enjoying this, he thought; you're crazy.\nBecause, in some weird and very approximate way, it was\nlike a run in the matrix. Get just wasted enough, find yourself\nin some desperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble, and\nit was possible to see Ninsei as a field of data, the way the\nmatrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish\ncell specialties. Then you could throw yourself into a highspeed\ndrift and skid, totally engaged but set apart from it all, and all\naround you the dance of biz, information interacting, data made\nflesh in the mazes of the black market....\nGo it, Case, he told himself. Suck 'em in. Last thing they'll\nexpect. He was half a block from the games arcade where he'd\nfirst met Linda Lee.\nHe bolted across Ninsei, scattering a pack of strolling sail-\nors. One of them screamed after him in Spanish. Then he was\nthrough the entrance, the sound crashing over him like surf,\nsubsonics throbbing in the pit of his stomach. Someone scored\na ten-megaton hit on Tank War Europa, a simulated air burst\ndrowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball\nmushroomed overhead. He cut to the right and loped up a flight\nof unpainted chip board stairs. He'd come here once with Wage,\nto discuss a deal in proscribed hormonal triggers with a man\ncalled Matsuga. He remembered the hallway, its stained mat-\nting, the row of identical doors leading to tiny office cubicles.\nOne door was open now. A Japanese girl in a sleeveless black\nt-shirt glanced up from a white terminal, behind her head a\ntravel poster of Greece, Aegian blue splashed with streamlined\nideograms.\n\"Get your security up here,\" Case told her.\nThen he sprinted down the corridor, out of her sight. The\nlast two doors were closed and, he assumed, locked. He spun\nand slammed the sole of his nylon running shoe into the blue-\n lacquered composition door at the far end. It popped, cheap\nhardware falling from the splintered frame. Darkness there, the\nwhite curve of a terminal housing. Then he was on the door\nto its right, both hands around the transparent plastic knob,\nleaning in with everything he had. Something snapped, and he\nwas inside. This was where he and Wage had met with Mat-\nsuga, but whatever front company Matsuga had operated was\nlong gone. No terminal, nothing. Light from the alley behind\nthe arcade, filtering in through soot blown plastic. He made out\na snake like loop of fiber optics protruding from a wall socket,\na pile of discarded food containers, and the blade less nacelle\nof an electric fan.\nThe window was a single pane of cheap plastic. He shrugged\nout of his jacket, bundled it around his right hand, and punched.\nIt split, requiring two more blows to free it from the frame.\nOver the muted chaos of the games, an alarm began to cycle,\ntriggered either by the broken window or by the girl at the head\nof the corridor.\nCase turned, pulled his jacket on, and flicked the cobra to\nfull extension.\nWith the door closed, he was counting on his tail to assume\nhe'd gone through the one he'd kicked half off its hinges. The\ncobra's bronze pyramid began to bob gently, the spring-steel\nshaft amplifying his pulse.\nNothing happened. There was only the surging of the alarm,\nthe crashing of the games, his heart hammering. When the fear\ncame, it was like some half-forgotten friend. Not the cold\nrapid mechanism of the dex-paranoia, but simple animal fear.\nHe'd lived for so long on a constant edge of anxiety that he'd\nalmost forgotten what real fear was.\nThis cubicle was the sort of place where people died. He\nmight die here. They might have guns....\nA crash, from the far end of the corridor. A man's voice,\nshouting something in Japanese. A scream, shrill terror. An-\nother crash.\nAnd footsteps, unhurried, coming closer.\nPassing his closed door. Pausing for the space of three rapid\nbeats of his heart. And returning. One, two, three. A bootheel\nscraped the matting.\nThe last of his octagon-induced bravado collapsed. He\nsnapped the cobra into its handle and scrambled for the window,\nblind with fear, his nerves screaming. He was up, out, and\nfalling, all before he was conscious of what he'd done. The\nimpact with pavement drove dull rods of pain through his shins.\nA narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch\nframed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the chassis of a\njunked console. He'd fallen face forward on a slab of soggy\nchip board, he rolled over, into the shadow of the console. The\ncubicle's window was a square of faint light. The alarm still\noscillated, louder here, the rear wall dulling the roar of the\ngames.\nA head appeared, framed in the window, back lit by the\nfluorescents in the corridor, then vanished. It returned, but he\nstill couldn't read the features. Glint of silver across the eyes.\n\"Shit,\" someone said, a woman, in the accent of the northern\nSprawl.\nThe head was gone. Case lay under the console for a long\ncount of twenty, then stood up. The steel cobra was still in his\nhand, and it took him a few seconds to remember what it was.\nHe limped away down the alley, nursing his left ankle.\nShin's pistol was a fifty-year-old Vietnamese imitation of\na South American copy of a Walther PPK, double-action on\nthe first shot, with a very rough pull. It was chambered for .22\nlong rifle, and Case would've preferred lead azide explosives\nto the simple Chinese hollow points Shin had sold him. Still\nit was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he\nmade his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in\nhis jacket pocket. The grips were bright red plastic molded in\na raised dragon motif, something to run your thumb across\nin the dark. He'd consigned the cobra to a dump canister on\nNinsei and dry-swallowed another octagon.\nThe pill lit his circuits and he rode the rush down Shiga to\nNinsei, then over to Baiitsu. His tail, he'd decided, was gone\nand that was fine. He had calls to make, biz to transact, and\nit wouldn't wait. A block down Baiitsu, toward the port, stood\na featureless ten-story office building in ugly yellow brick. Its\nwindows were dark now, but a faint glow from the roof was\nvisible if you craned your neck. An unlit neon sign near the\nmain entrance offered CHEAP HOTEL under a cluster of ideo-\ngrams. If the place had another name, Case didn't know it; it\nwas always referred to as Cheap Hotel. You reached it through\nan alley off Baiitsu, where an elevator waited at the foot of a\ntransparent shaft. The elevator, like Cheap Hotel, was an af-\nterthought, lashed to the building with bamboo and epoxy. Case\nclimbed into the plastic cage and used his key, an unmarked\nlength of rigid magnetic tape.\nCase had rented a coffin here, on a weekly basis, since he'd\narrived in Chiba, but he'd never slept in Cheap Hotel. He slept\nin cheaper places.\nThe elevator smelled of perfume and cigarettes; the sides\nof the cage was scratched and thumb-smudged. As it passed the\nfifth floor, he saw the lights of Ninsei. He drummed his fingers\nagainst the pistol grip as the cage slowed with a gradual hiss.\nAs always, it came to a full stop with a violent jolt, but he\nwas ready for it. He stepped out into the courtyard that served\nthe place as some combination of lobby and lawn.\nCentered in the square carpet of green plastic turf, a lapanese\nteenager sat behind a C-shaped console, reading a textbook.\nThe white fiberglass coffins were racked in a framework of\nindustrial scaffolding. Six tiers of coffins, ten coffins on a side.\nCase nodded in the boy's direction and limped across the plastic\ngrass to the nearest ladder. The compound was roofed with\ncheap laminated matting that rattled in a strong wind and leaked\nwhen it rained, but the coffins were reasonably difficult to open\nwithout a key.\nThe expansion-grate catwalk vibrated with his weight as he\nedged his way along the third tier to Number 92. The coffins\nwere three meters long, the oval hatches a meter wide and just\nunder a meter and a half tall. He fed his key into the slot and\nwaited for verification from the house computer. Magnetic bolts\nthudded reassuringly and the hatch rose vertically with a creak\nof springs. Fluorescents flickered on as he crawled in, pulling\nthe hatch shut behind him and slapping the panel that activated\nthe manual latch.\nThere was nothing in Number 92 but a standard Hitachi\npocket computer and a small white styrofoam cooler chest. The\ncooler contained the remains of three ten-kilo slabs of dry ice\ncarefully wrapped in paper to delay evaporation, and a spun\naluminum lab flask. Crouching on the brown temper foam slab\nthat was both floor and bed, Case took Shin's .22 from his\npocket and put it on top of the cooler. Then he took off his\njacket. The coffin's terminal was molded into one concave wall,\nopposite a panel listing house rules in seven languages. Case\ntook the pink handset from its cradle and punched a Hongkong\nnumber from memory. He let it ring five times, then hung up.\nHis buyer for the three megabytes of hot RAM in the Hitachi\nwasn't taking calls.\nHe punched a Tokyo number in Shinjuku.\nA woman answered, something in Japanese.\n\"Snake Man there?\"\n\"Very good to hear from you,\" said Snake Man, coming in\non an extension. \"I've been expecting your call.\"\n\"I got the music you wanted.\" Glancing at the cooler.\n\"I'm very glad to hear that. We have a cash flow problem.\nCan you front?\"\n\"Oh, man, I really need the money bad....\"\nSnake Man hung up.\n\"You shit \" Case said to the humming receiver. He stared\nat the cheap little pistol.\n\"Iffy,\" he said, \"it's all looking very iffy tonight.\"", "Case walked into the Chat an hour before dawn, both hands\nin the pockets of his jacket; one held the rented pistol, the other\nthe aluminum flask.\nRatz was at a rear table, drinking Apollonaris water from\na beer pitcher, his hundred and twenty kilos of doughy flesh\ntilted against the wall on a creaking chair. A Brazilian kid\ncalled Kurt was on the bar, tending a thin crowd of mostly\nsilent drunks. Ratz's plastic arm buzzed as he raised the pitcher\nand drank. His shaven head was filmed with sweat. \"You look\nbad, friend artiste,\" he said, flashing the wet ruin of his teeth.\n\"I'm doing just fine,\" said Case, and grinned like a skull.\n\"Super fine.\" He sagged into the chair opposite Ratz, hands\nstill in his pockets.\n\"And you wander back and forth in this portable bombshelter\nbuilt of booze and ups, sure. Proof against the grosser emotions,\nyes?\"\n\"Why don't you get off my case, Ratz? You seen Wage?\"\n\"Proof against fear and being alone,\" the bartender contin-\nued. \"Listen to the fear. Maybe it's your friend.\"\n\"You hear anything about a fight in the arcade tonight, Ratz?\nSomebody hurt?\"\n\"Crazy cut a security man.\" He shrugged. \"A girl, they\nsay.\"\n\"I gotta talk to Wage, Ratz, I. . .\"\n\"Ah.\" Ratz's mouth narrowed, compressed into a single\nline. He was looking past Case, toward the entrance. \"I think\nyou are about to.\"\nCase had a sudden flash of the shuriken in their window.\nThe speed sang in his head. The pistol in his hand was slippery\nwith sweat.\n\"Herr Wage,\" Ratz said, slowly extending his pink manip-\nulator as if he expected it to be shaken. \"How great a pleasure.\nToo seldom do you honor us.\"\nCase turned his head and looked up into Wage's face. It\nwas a tanned and forgettable mask. The eyes were vat grown\nsea-green Nikon transplants. Wage wore a suit of gunmetal\nsilk and a simple bracelet of platinum on either wrist. He was\nflanked by his Joe boys, nearly identical young men, their arms\nand shoulders bulging with grafted muscle.\n\"How you doing, Case?\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Ratz, picking up the table's heaped ash-\ntray in his pink plastic claw, \"I want no trouble here.\" The\nashtray was made of thick, shatterproof plastic, and advertised\nTsingtao beer. Ratz crushed it smoothly, butts and shards of\ngreen plastic cascading onto the table top. \"You understand?\"\n\"Hey, sweetheart,\" said one of the Joe boys, \"you wanna try\nthat thing on me?\"\n\"Don't bother aiming for the legs, Kurt,\" Ratz said, his tone\nconversational. Case glanced across the room and saw the Bra-\nzilian standing on the bar, aiming a Smith & Wesson riot gun\nat the trio. The thing's barrel, made of paper-thin alloy wrapped\nwith a kilometer of glass filament, was wide enough to swallow\na fist. The skeletal magazine revealed five fat orange cartridges,\nsubsonic sandbag jellies.\n\"Technically nonlethal,\" said Ratz.\n\"Hey, Ratz,\" Case said, \"I owe you one.\"\nThe bartender shrugged. \"Nothing, you owe me. These,\"\nand he glowered at Wage and the Joe boys, \"should know better.\nYou don't take anybody off in the Chatsubo.\"\nWage coughed. \"So who's talking about taking anybody\noff? We just wanna talk business. Case and me, we work\ntogether.\"\nCase pulled the .22 out of his pocket and level led it at\nWage's crotch. \"I hear you wanna do me.\" Ratz's pink claw\nclosed around the pistol and Case let his hand go limp.\n\"Look, Case, you tell me what the fuck is going on with\nyou, you wig or something? What's this shit I'm trying to kill\nyou?\" Wage turned to the boy on his left. \"You two go back\nto the Namban. Wait for me.\"\nCase watched as they crossed the bar, which was now en-\ntirely deserted except for Kurt and a drunken sailor in khakis,\nwho was curled at the foot of a barstool. The barrel of the\nSmith & Wesson tracked the two to the door, then swung back\nto cover Wage. The magazine of Case's pistol clattered on the\ntable. Ratz held the gun in his claw and pumped the round out\nof the chamber.\n\"Who told you I was going to hit you, Case?\" Wage asked.\nLinda.\n\"Who told you, man? Somebody trying to set you up?\"\nThe sailor moaned and vomited explosively.\n\"Get him out of here,\" Ratz called to Kurt, who was sitting\non the edge of the bar now, the Smith & Wesson across his\nlap, lighting a cigarette.\nCase felt the weight of the night come down on him like a\nbag of wet sand settling behind his eyes. He took the flask out\nof his pocket and handed it to Wage. \"All I got. Pituitaries.\nGet you five hundred if you move it fast. Had the rest of my\nroll in some RAM, but that's gone by now.\"\n\"You okay, Case?\" The flask had already vanished behind\na gunmetal lapel. \"I mean, fine, this'll square us, but you look\nbad. Like hammered shit. You better go somewhere and sleep.\"\n\"Yeah.\" He stood up and felt the Chat sway around him.\n\"Well, I had this fifty, but I gave it to somebody.\" He giggled.\nHe picked up the .22's magazine and the one loose cartridge\nand dropped them into one pocket, then put the pistol in the\nother. \"I gotta see Shin, get my deposit back.\"\n\"Go home,\" said Ratz, shifting on the creaking chair with\nsomething like embarrassment. \"Artiste. Go home.\"\nHe felt them watching as he crossed the room and shouldered\nhis way past the plastic doors.", "\"Bitch,\" he said to the rose tint over Shiga. Down on Ninsei\nthe holograms were vanishing like ghosts, and most of the neon\nwas already cold and dead. He sipped thick black coffee from\na street vendor's foam thimble and watched the sun come up.\n\"You fly away, honey. Towns like this are for people who like\nthe way down.\" But that wasn't it, really, and he was finding\nit increasingly hard to maintain the sense of betrayal. She just\nwanted a ticket home, and the RAM in his Hitachi would buy\nit for her, if she could find the right fence. And that business\nwith the fifty; she'd almost turned it down, knowing she was\nabout to rip him for the rest of what he had.\nWhen he climbed out of the elevator, the same boy was on\nthe desk. Different textbook. \"Good buddy,\" Case called across\nthe plastic turf, \"you don't need to tell me. I know already.\nPretty lady came to visit, said she had my key. Nice little tip\nfor you, say fifty New ones?\" The boy put down his book.\n\"Woman,\" Case said, and drew a line across his forehead with\nhis thumb. \"Silk.\" He smiled broadly. The boy smiled back,\nnodded. \"Thanks, ass hole,\" Case said.\nOn the catwalk, he had trouble with the lock. She'd messed\nit up somehow when she'd fiddled it, he thought. Beginner.\nHe knew where to rent a black box that would open anything\nin Cheap Hotel. Fluorescents came on as he crawled in.\n\"Close the hatch real slow, friend. You still got that Saturday\nnight special you rented from the waiter?\"\nShe sat with her back to the wall, at the far end of the coffin.\nShe had her knees up, resting her wrists on them, the pepper box\nmuzzle of a flechette pistol emerged from her hands.\n\"That you in the arcade?\" He pulled the hatch down.\n\"Where's Linda?\"\n\"Hit that latch switch.\"\nHe did.\n\"That your girl? Linda?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"She's gone. Took your Hitachi. Real nervous kid. What\nabout the gun, man?\" She wore mirrored glasses. Her clothes\nwere black, the heels of black boots deep in the temper foam.\n\"I took it back to Shin, got my deposit. Sold his bullets\nback to him for half what I paid. You want the money?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Want some dry ice? All I got, right now.\"\n\"What got into you tonight? Why'd you pull that scene at\nthe arcade? I had to mess up this rentacop came after me with\nnun chucks. \"\n\"Linda said you were gonna kill me.\"\n\"Linda said? I never saw her before I came up here.\"\n\"You aren't with Wage?\"\nShe shook her head. He realized that the glasses were sur-\ngically inset, sealing her sockets. The silver lenses seemed to\ngrow from smooth pale skin above her cheekbones, framed by\ndark hair cut in a rough shag. The fingers curled around the\nfletcher were slender, white, tipped with polished burgundy.\nThe nails looked artificial. \"I think you screwed up, Case. I\nshowed up and you just fit me right into your reality picture.\"\n\"So what do you want, lady?\" He sagged back against the\nhatch.", "\"You. One live body, brains still somewhat intact. Molly,\nCase. My name's Molly. I'm collecting you for the man I work\nfor. Just wants to talk, is all. Nobody wants to hurt you \"\n\"That's good.\"\n\"'Cept I do hurt people sometimes, Case. I guess it's just\nthe way I'm wired.\" She wore tight black glove leather jeans\nand a bulky black jacket cut from some matte fabric that seemed\nto absorb light. \"If I put this dart gun away, will you be easy,\nCase? You look like you like to take stupid chances.\"\n\"Hey, I'm very easy. I'm a pushover, no problem.\"\n\"That's fine, man.\" The fletcher vanished into the black\njacket. \"Because you try to fuck around with me, you'll be\ntaking one of the stupidest chances of your whole life.\"\nShe held out her hands, palms up, the white fingers slightly\nspread, and with a barely audible click, ten double-edged, four-\n centimeter scalpel blades slid from their housings beneath the\nburgundy nails.\nShe smiled. The blades slowly withdrew."], "2": ["After a year of coffins, the room on the twenty-fifth floor\nof the Chiba Hilton seemed enormous. It was ten meters by\neight, half of a suite. A white Braun coffee maker steamed on\na low table by the sliding glass panels that opened onto a narrow\nbalcony.\n\"Get some coffee in you. Look like you need it.\" She took\noff her black jacket, the fletcher hung beneath her arm in a\nblack nylon shoulder rig. She wore a sleeveless gray pullover\nwith plain steel zips across each shoulder. Bulletproof, Case\ndecided, slopping coffee into a bright red mug. His arms and\nlegs felt like they were made out of wood.\n\"Case.\" He looked up, seeing the man for the first time.\n\"My name is Armitage.\" The dark robe was open to the waist,\nthe broad chest hairless and muscular, the stomach flat and\nhard. Blue eyes so pale they made Case think of bleach. \"Sun's\nup, Case. This is your lucky day, boy.\"\nCase whipped his arm sideways and the man easily ducked\nthe scalding coffee. Brown stain running down the imitation\nrice paper wall. He saw the angular gold ring through the left\nlobe. Special Forces. The man smiled.\n\"Get your coffee, Case,\" Molly said. \"You're okay, but\nyou're not going anywhere 'til Armitage has his say.\" She sat\ncross legged on a silk futon and began to fieldstrip the fletcher\nwithout bothering to look at it. Twin mirrors tracking as he\ncrossed to the table and refilled his cup.\n\"Too young to remember the war, aren't you, Case?\" Ar-\nmitage ran a large hand back through his cropped brown hair.\nA heavy gold bracelet flashed on his wrist. \"Leningrad, Kiev,\nSiberia. We invented you in Siberia, Case.\"\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\n\"Screaming Fist, Case. You've heard the name.\"\n\"Some kind of run, wasn't it? Tried to burn this Russian\nnexus with virus programs. Yeah, I heard about it. And nobody\ngot out.\"\nHe sensed abrupt tension. Armitagc walkcd to the window\nand looked out over Tokyo Bay. \"That isn't true. One unit\nmade it back to Helsinki, Case.\"\nCase shrugged, sipped coffee.\n\"You're a console cowboy. The prototypes of the programs\nyou use to crack industrial banks were developed for Screaming\nFist. For the assault on the Kirensk computer nexus. Basic\nmodule was a Nightwing micro light, a pilot, a matrix deck, a\njockey. We were running a virus called Mole. The Mole series\nwas the first generation of real intrusion programs.\"\n\"Icebreakers,\" Case said, over the rim of the red mug.\n\"Ice from ICE, intrusion countermeasures electronics.\"\n\"Problem is, mister, I'm no jockey now, so I think I'll just\nbe going....\"\n\"I was there, Case; I was there when they invented your\nkind.\"\n\"You got zip to do with me and my kind, buddy. You're\nrich enough to hire expensive razor girls to haul my ass up here,\nis all. I'm never gonna punch any deck again, not for you or\nanybody else.\" He crossed to the window and looked down.\n\"That's where I live now.\"\n\"Our profile says you're trying to con the street into killing\nyou when you're not looking.\"\n\"Profile?\"\n\"We've built up a detailed model. Bought a go-to for each\nof your aliases and ran the skim through some military software.\nYou're suicidal, Casc. The model gives you a month on the\noutside. And our medical projection says you'll need a new\npancreas inside a year.\"\n\"'We.'\" He met the faded blue eyes. \"'We' who?\"\n\"What would you say if I told you we could correct your\nneural damage, Case'?\" Armitage suddenly looked to Case as\nif he were carved from a block of metal; inert, enormously\nheavy. A statue. He knew now that this was a dream, and that\nsoon he'd wake. Armitage wouldn't speak again. Case's dreams\nalways ended in these freeze frames, and now this one was\nover.\n\"What would you say, Case?\"\nCase looked out over the Bay and shivered.\n\"I'd say you were full of shit.\"\nArrnitage nodded.\n\"Then I'd ask what your terms were.\"\n\"Not very different than what you're used to, Case.\"\n\"Let the man get some sleep, Armitage,\" Molly said from\nher futon, the components of the fletcher spread on the silk\nlike some expensive puzzle. \"He's coming apart at the seams.\"\n\"Terms,\" Case said, \"and now. Right now.\"\nHe was still shivering. He couldn't stop shivering.", "The clinic was nameless, expensively appointed, a cluster\nof sleek pavilions separated by small formal gardens. He re-\nmembered the place from the round he'd made his first month\nin Chiba.\n\"Scared, Case. You're real scared.\" It was Sunday afternoon\nand he stood with Molly in a sort of courtyard. White boulders,\na stand of green bamboo, black gravel raked into smooth waves.\nA gardener, a thing like a large metal crab, was tending the\nbamboo.\n\"It'll work, Case. You got no idea, the kind of stuff Ar-\nmitage has. Like he's gonna pay these nerve boys for fixing\nyou with the program he's giving them to tell them how to do\nit. He'll put them three years ahead of the competition. You\ngot any idea what that's worth?\" She hooked thumbs in the\nbelt loops of her leather jeans and rocked backward on the\nlacquered heels of cherry red cowboy boots. The narrow toes\nwere sheathed in bright Mexican silver. The lenses were empty\nquicksilver, regarding him with an insect calm.\n\"You're street samurai,\" he said. \"How long you work for\nhim?\"\n\"Couple of months.\"\n\"What about before that?\"\n\"For somebody else. Working girl, you know?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"Funny, Case.\"\n\"What's funny?\"\n\"It's like I know you. That profile he's got. I know how\nyou're wired.\"\n\"You don't know me, sister.\"\n\"You're okay, Case. What got you, it's just called bad luck.\"\n\"How about him? He okay, Molly?\" The robot crab moved\ntoward them, picking its way over the waves of gravel. Its\nbronze carapace might have been a thousand years old. When\nit was within a meter of her boots, it fired a burst of light, then\nfroze for an instant, analyzing data obtained.\n\"What I always think about first, Case, is my own sweet\nass.\" The crab had altered course to avoid her, but she kicked\nit with a smooth precision, the silver boot-tip clanging on the\ncarapace. The thing fell on its back, but the bronze limbs soon\nrighted it.\nCase sat on one of the boulders, scuffing at the symmetry\nof the gravel waves with the toes of his shoes. He began to\nsearch his pockets for cigarettes. \"In your shirt,\" she said.\n\"You want to answer my question?\" He fished a wrinkled\nYeheyuan from the pack and she lit it for him with a thin slab\nof German steel that looked as though it belonged on an op-\nerating table.\n\"Well, I'll tell you, the man's definitely on to something.\nHe's got big money now, and he's never had it before, and he\ngets more all the time.\" Case noticed a certain tension around\nher mouth. \"Or maybe, maybe something's on to him....\"\nShe shrugged.\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"I don't know, exactly. I know I don't know who or what\nwe're really working for.\"\nHe stared at the twin mirrors. Leaving the Hilton, Saturday\nmorning, he'd gone back to Cheap Hotel and slept for ten hours .\nThen he'd taken a long and pointless walk along the port's\nsecurity perimeter, watching the gulls turn circles beyond the\nchain link. If she'd followed him, she'd done a good job of it.\nHe'd avoided Night City. He'd waited in the coffin for Ar-\nmitage's call. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this\ngirl with a gymnast's body and conjurer's hands.\n\"If you'll come in now, sir, the anesthetist is waiting to\nmeet you.\" The technician bowed, turned, and reentered the\nclinic without waiting to see if Case would follow.", "Cold steel odor. Ice caressed his spine.\nLost, so small amid that dark, hands grown cold, body image\nfading down corridors of television sky.\nVoices.\nThen black fire found the branching tributaries of the nerves,\npain beyond anything to which the name of pain is given....", "Hold still. Don't move.\nAnd Ratz was there, and Linda Lee, Wage and Lonny Zone,\na hundred faces from the neon forest, sailors and hustlers and\nwhores, where the sky is poisoned silver, beyond chain link\nand the prison of the skull.\nGoddamn don't you move.\nWhere the sky faded from hissing static to the non color of\nthe matrix, and he glimpsed the shuriken, his stars.\n\"Stop it, Case, I gotta find your vein!\"\nShe was straddling his chest, a blue plastic syrette in one\nhand. \"You don't lie still, I'll slit your fucking throat. You're\nstill full of endorphin inhibitors.\"", "He woke and found her stretched beside him in the dark.\nHis neck was brittle, made of twigs. There was a steady\npulse of pain midway down his spine. Images formed and\nreformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl's towers and\nragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the\nshade beneath a bridge or overpass....\n\"Case? It's Wednesday, Case.\" She moved, rolling over,\nreaching across him. A breast brushed his upper arm. He heard\nher tear the foil seal from a bottle of water and drink. \"Here.\"\nShe put the bottle in his hand. \"I can see in the dark, Case.\nMicro channel image-amps in my glasses.\"\n\"My back hurts.\"\n\"That's where they replaced your fluid. Changed your blood\ntoo. Blood 'cause you got a new pancreas thrown into the deal.\nAnd some new tissue patched into your liver. The nerve stuff\nI dun no. Lot of injections. They didn't have to open anything\nup for the main show.\" She settled back beside him. \"It's\n2:43:12 AM, Case. Got a readout chipped into my optic nerve.\"\nHe sat up and tried to sip from the bottle. Gagged, coughed,\nlukewarm water spraying his chest and thighs.\n\"I gotta punch deck, ' he heard himself say. He was groping\nfor his clothes. \"I gotta know....\"\nShe laughed. Small strong hands gripped his upper arms.\n\"Sorry, hotshot. Eight day wait. Your nervous system would\nfall out on the floor if you jacked in now. Doctor's orders.\nBesides, they figure it worked. Check you in a day or so.\" He\nlay down again.\n\"Where are we?\"\n\"Home. Cheap Hotel.\"\n\"Where's Armitage?\"\n\"Hilton, selling beads to the natives or something. We're\nout of here soon, man. Amsterdam, Paris, then back to the\nSprawl.\" She touched his shoulder. \"Roll over. I give a good\nmassage.\"\nHe lay on his stomach, arms stretched forward, tips of his\nfingers against the walls of the coffin. She settled over the\nsmall of his back, kneeling on the temper foam, the leather\njeans cool against his skin. Her fingers brushed his neck.\n\"How come you're not at the Hilton?\"\nShe answered him by reaching back, between his thighs\nand gently encircling his scrotum with thumb and forefinger.\nShe rocked there for a minute in the dark, erect above him,\nher other hand on his neck. The leather of her jeans creaked\nsoftly with the movement. Case shifted, feeling himself harden\nagainst the temper foam.\nHis head throbbed, but the brittleness in his neck seemed\nto retreat. He raised himself on one elbow, rolled, sank back\nagainst the foam, pulling her down, licking her breasts, small\nhard nipples sliding wet across his cheek. He found the zip on\nthe leather jeans and tugged it down.\n\"It's okay,\" she said, \"I can see.\" Sound of the jeans peeling\ndown. She struggled beside him until she could kick them away.\nShe threw a leg across him and he touched her face. Unexpected\nhardness of the implanted lenses. \"Don't,\" she said, \"finger-\nprints.\"\nNow she straddled him again, took his hand, and closed it\nover her, his thumb along the cleft of her buttocks, his fingers\nspread across the labia. As she began to lower herself, the\nimages came pulsing back, the faces, fragments of neon arriv-\ning and receding. She slid down around him and his back arched\nconvulsively. She rode him that way, impaling herself, slipping\ndown on him again and again, until they both had come, his\norgasm flaring blue in a timeless space, a vastness like the\nmatrix, where the faces were shredded and blown away down\nhurricane corridors, and her inner thighs were strong and wet\nagainst his hips.", "On Nisei, a thinner, weekday version of the crowd went\nthrough the motions of the dance. Waves of sound rolled from\nthe arcades and pachinko parlors. Case glanced into the Chat\nand saw Zone watching over his girls in the warm, beer-smell-\ning twilight. Ratz was tending bar.\n\"You seen Wage, Ratz?\"\n\"Not tonight.\" Ratz made a point of raising an eyebrow at\nMolly.\n\"You see him, tell him I got his money.\"\n\"Luck changing, my artiste?\"\n\"Too soon to tell.\"", "\"Well, I gotta see this guy,\" Case said, watching his re-\nflection in her glasses. \"I got biz to cancel out of.\"\n\"Armitage won't like it, I let you out of my sight.\" She\nstood beneath Deane's melting clock, hands on her hips.\n\"The guy won't talk to me if you're there.

She shook her head.\n\"I got people in Singapore, Tokyo connections in Shinjuku\nand Asakuza, and they'll go down, understand?\" he lied, his\nhand on the shoulder of her black jacket. \"Five. Five minutes.\nBy your clock, okay?\"\n\"Not what I'm paid for.\"\n\"What you're paid for is one thing. Me letting some tight\nfriends die because you're too literal about your instructions is\nsomething else.\"\n\"Bullshit. Tight friends my ass. You're going in there to\ncheck us out with your smuggler.\" She put a booted foot up\non the dust-covered Kandinsky coffee table.\n\"Ah, Case, sport, it does look as though your companion\nthere is definitely armed, aside from having a fair amount of\nsilicon in her head . What is this about, exactly?\" Deane ' s ghostly\ncough seemed to hang in the air between them.\n\"Hold on, Julie. Anyway, I'll be coming in alone.\"\n\"You can be sure of that, old son. Wouldn't have it any\nother way.\"\n\"Okay,\" she said. \"Go. But five Minutes. Any more and\nI'll come in and cool your tight friend permanently. And while\nyou're at it, you try to figure something out.\"\n\"What's that?\"\n\"Why I'm doing you the favor.\" She turned and walked\nout, past the stacked white modules of preserved ginger.\n\"Keeping stranger company than usual, Case?\" asked Julie.\n\"Julie, she's gone. You wanna let me in? Please, Julie?\"\nThe bolts worked. \"Slowly, Case,\" said the voice.\n\"Turn on the works, Julie, all the stuff in the desk,\" Case\nsaid, taking his place in the swivel chair.\n\"It's on all the time,\" Deane said mildly, taking a gun from\nbehind the exposed works of his old mechanical typewriter and\naiming it carefully at Case. It was a belly gun, a magnum\nrevolver with the barrel sawn down to a nub. The front of the\ntrigger-guard had been cut away and the grips wrapped with\nwhat looked like old masking tape. Case thought it looked very\nstrange in Dean's manicured pink hands. \"Just taking care, you\nUnderstand. Nothing personal. Now tell me what you want.\"\n\"I need a history lesson, Julie. And a go-to on somebody.\"\n\"What's moving, old son'?\" Deane's shirt was candy-striped\ncotton, the collar white and rigid, like porcelain.\n\"Me, Julie. I'm leaving. Gone. But do me the favor, okay?\"\n\"Go-to on whom, old son?\"\n\"Gaijin name of Armitage, suite in the Hilton.\"\nDeane put the pistol down. \"Sit still, Case.\" He tapped\nsomething out on a lap terminal. \"It seems as though you know\nas much as my net does, Case. This gentleman seems to have\na temporary arrangement with the Yakuza, and the sons of the\nneon chrysanthemum have ways of screening their allies from\nthe likes of me. I wouldn't have it any other way. Now, history.\nYou said history.\" He picked up the gun again, but didn't point\nit directly at Case. \"What sort of history?\"\n\"The war. You in the war, Julie?\"\n\"The war? What's there to know? Lasted three weeks.\"\n\"Screaming Fist.\"\n\"Famous. Don't they teach you history these days? Great\nbloody postwar political football, that was. Watergated all to\nhell and back. Your brass, Case, your Sprawlside brass in,\nwhere was it, McLean? In the bunkers, all of that... great\nscandal. Wasted a fair bit of patriotic young flesh in order to\ntest some new technology. They knew about the Russians' de-\nfenses, it came out later. Knew about the emps, magnetic pulse\nweapons. Sent these fellows in regardless, just to see.\" Deane\nshrugged. \"Turkey shoot for Ivan.\"\n\"Any of those guys make it out?\"\n\"Christ,'' Deane said, \"it's been bloody years.... Though\nI do think a few did. One of the teams. Got hold of a Sov\ngunship. Helicopter, you know. Flew it back to Finland. Didn't\nhave entry codes, of course, and shot hell out of the Finnish\ndefense forces in the process. Special Forces types.\" Deane\nsniffed. \"Bloody hell.\"\nCase nodded. The smell of preserved ginger was over-\nwhelming.\n\"I spent the war in Lisbon, you know,\" Deane said, putting\nthe gun down. \"Lovely place, Lisbon.\"\n\"In the service, Julie?\"\n\"Hardly. Though I did see action.\" Deane smiled his pink\nsmile. \"Wonderful what a war can do for one's markets.\"\n\"Thanks, Julie. I owe you one.\"\n\"Hardly, Case. And goodbye.\"", "And later he'd tell himself that the evening at Sammi's had\nfelt wrong from the start, that even as he'd followed Molly\nalong that corridor, shuffling through a trampled mulch of ticket\nstubs and styrofoam cups, he'd sensed it. Linda's death, wait-\ning....\nThey'd gone to the Namban, after he'd seen Deane, and\npaid off his debt to Wage with a roll of Armitage's New Yen.\nWage had liked that, his boys had liked it less, and Molly had\ngrinned at Case's side with a kind of ecstatic feral intensity,\nobviously longing for one of them to make a move. Then he'd\ntaken her back to the Chat for a drink.\n\"Wasting your time, cowboy,\" Molly said, when Case took\nan octagon from the pocket of his jacket.\n\"How's that? You want one?\" He held the pill out to her.\n\"Your new pancreas, Case, and those plugs in your liver.\nArmitage had them designed to bypass that shit.\" She tapped\nthe octagon with one burgundy nail. \"You're biochemically\nincapable of getting off on amphetamine or cocaine.\"\n\"Shit,\" he said. He looked at the octagon, then at her.\n\"Eat it. Eat a dozen. Nothing'll happen.\"\nHe did. Nothing did.\nThree beers later, she was asking Ratz about the fights.\n\"Sammi's,\" Ratz said.\n\"I'll pass,\" Case said, \"I hear they kill each other down\nthere.\"\nAn hour later, she was buying tickets from a skinny Thai\nin a white t-shirt and baggy rugby shorts.\nSammi's was an inflated dome behind a port side warehouse,\ntaut gray fabric reinforced with a net of thin steel cables. The\ncorridor, with a door at either end, was a crude airlock pre-\nserving the pressure differential that supported the dome. Flu-\norescent rings were screwed to the plywood ceiling at intervals,\nbut most of them had been broken. The air was damp and close\nwith the smell of sweat and concrete.\nNone of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the\ntense hush, the towering puppets of light beneath the dome.\nConcrete sloped away in tiers to a kind of central stage, a raised\ncircle ringed with a glittering thicket of projection gear. No\nlight but the holograms that shifted and flickered above the\nring, reproducing the movements of the two men below. Strata\nof cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck\ncurrents set up by the blowers that supported the dome. No\nsound but the muted purring of the blowers and the amplified\nbreathing of the fighters.\nReflected colors flowed across Molly's lenses as the men\ncircled. The holograms were ten-power magnifications; at ten,\nthe knives they held were just under a meter long. The knife-\n fighter's grip is the fencer's grip, Case remembered, the fingers\ncurled, thumb aligned with blade. The knives seemed to move\nof their own accord, gliding with a ritual lack of urgency through\nthe arcs and passes of their dance, point passing point, as the\nmen waited for an opening. Molly's upturned face was smooth\nand still, watching.\n\"I'll go find us some food,\" Case said. She nodded, lost in\ncontemplation of the dance.\nHe didn't like this place.\nHe turned and walked back into the shadows. Too dark.\nToo quiet.\nThe crowd, he saw, was mostly Japanese. Not really a Night\nCity crowd. Teaks down from the arcologies. He supposed that\nmeant the arena had the approval of some corporate recreational\ncommittee. He wondered briefly what it would be like, working\nall your life for one zaibatsu. Company housing, company\nhymn, company funeral.\nHe'd made nearly a full circuit of the dome before he found\nthe food stalls. He bought yakitori on skewers and two tall\nwaxy cartons of beer. Glancing up at the holograms, he saw\nthat blood laced one figure's chest. Thick brown sauce trickled\ndown the skewers and over his knuckles.\nSeven days and he'd jack in. If he closed his eyes now,\nhe'd see the matrix.\nShadows twisted as the holograms swung through their dance.\nThen the fear began to knot between his shoulders. A cold\ntrickle of sweat worked its way down and across his ribs. The\noperation hadn't worked. He was still here, still meat, no Molly\nwaiting, her eyes locked on the circling knives, no Armitage\nwaiting in the Hilton with tickets and a new passport and\nmoney. It was all some dream, some pathetic fantasy.... Hot\ntears blurred his vision.\nBlood sprayed from a jugular in a red gout of light. And\nnow the crowd was screaming, rising, screaming--as one fig-\nure crumpled, the hologram fading, flickering....\nRaw edge of vomit in his throat. He closed his eyes, took\na deep breath, opened them, and saw Linda Lee step past him\nher gray eyes blind with fear. She wore the same French fa-\ntigues.\nAnd gone. Into shadow.\nPure mindless reflex: he threw the beer and chicken down\nand ran after her. He might have called her name, but he'd\nnever be sure.\nAfterimage of a single hair-fine line of red light. Seared\nconcrete beneath the thin soles of his shoes.\nHer white sneakers flashing, close to the curving wall now\nand again the ghost line of the laser branded across his eye,\nbobbing in his vision as he ran.\nSomeone tripped him. Concrete tore his palms.\nHe rolled and kicked, failing to connect. A thin boy, spiked\nblond hair lit from behind in a rainbow nimbus, was leaning\nover him. Above the stage, a figure turned, knife held high,\nto the cheering crowd. The boy smiled and drew something\nfrom his sleeve. A razor, etched in red as a third beam blinked\npast them into the dark. Case saw the razor dipping for his\nthroat like a dowser's wand.\nThe face was erased in a humming cloud of microscopic\nexplosions. Molly's fletchettes, at twenty rounds per second.\nThe boy coughed once, convulsively, and toppled across Case's\nlegs.\nHe was walking toward the stalls, into the shadows. He\nlooked down, expecting to see that needle of ruby emerge from\nhis chest. Nothing. He found her. She was thrown down at the\nfoot of a concrete pillar, eyes closed. There was a smell of\ncooked meat. The crowd was chanting the winner's name. A\nbeer vendor was wiping his taps with a dark rag. One white\nsneaker had come off, somehow, and lay beside her head.\nFollow the wall. Curve of concrete. Hands in pockets. Keep\nwalking. Past unseeing faces, every eye raised to the victor's\nimage above the ring. Once a seamed European face danced\nin the glare of a match, lips pursed around the short stem of a\nmetal pipe. Tang of hashish. Case walked on, feeling nothing.\n\"Case.\" Her mirrors emerged from deeper shadow. \"You\nokay?\"\nSomething mewlcd and bubbled in the dark behind her.\nHe shook his head.\n\"Fight's over, Case. Time to go home.\"\nHe tried to walk past her. back into the dark, where some-\nthing was dying. She stopped him with a hand on his chest.\n\"Friends of your tight friend. Killed your girl for you. You\nhaven't done too well for friends in this town, have you? We\ngot a partial profile on that old bastard when we did you, man.\nHe'd fry anybody, for a few New ones. The one back there\nsaid they got on to her when she was trying to fence your RAM.\nJust cheaper for them to kill her and take it. Save a little\nmoney.... I got the one who had the laser to tell me all about\nit. Coincidence we were here, but I had to make sure.\" Her\nmouth was hard, lips pressed into a thin line.\nCase felt as though his brain were jammed. \"Who,\" he said,\n\"who sent them?\"\nShe passed him a blood-flecked bag of preserved ginger.\nHe saw that her hands were sticky with blood. Back in the\nshadows, someone made wet sounds and died.", "After the postoperative check at the clinic, Molly took him\nto the port. Armitage was waiting. He'd chartered a hovercraft.\nThe last Case saw of Chiba were the dark angles of the arcol-\nogies. Then a mist closed over the black water and the drifting\nshoals of waste.", "PART TWO.

He watched himself buy a flat plastic flask of Danish\nvodka at some kiosk, an hour before dawn.\nSomewhere down in the Sprawl's ferro-concrete roots, a\ntrain drove a column of stale air through a tunnel. The train\nitself was silent, gliding over its induction cushion, but dis-\nplaced air made the tunnel sing, bass down into subsonics.\nVibration reached the room where he lay and caused dust to\nrise from the cracks in the dessicated parquet floor.\nOpening his eyes, he saw Molly, naked and just out of reach\nacross an expanse of very new pink temper foam. Overhead,\nsunlight filtered through the soot-stained grid of a skylight.\nOne half-meter square of glass had been replaced with chip-\n board, a fat gray cable emerging there to dangle within a few\ncentimeters of the floor. He lay on his side and watched her\nbreathe, her breasts, the sweep of a flank defined with the\nfunctional elegance of a war plane's fusilage. Her body was\nspare, neat, the muscles like a dancer's.\nThe room was large. He sat up. The room was empty, aside\nfrom the wide pink bedslab and two nylon bags, new and\nidentical, that lay beside it. Blank walls, no windows, a single\nwhite-painted steel fire door. The walls were coated with count-\nless layers of white latex paint. Factory space. He knew this\nkind of room, this kind of building; the tenants would operate\nin the inter zone where art wasn't quite crime, crime not quite\nart.\nHe was home.\nHe swung his feet to the floor. It was made of little blocks\nof wood, some missing, others loose. His head ached. He\nremembered Amsterdam, another room, in the Old City section\nof the Centrum, buildings centuries old. Molly back from the\ncanal's edge with orange juice and eggs. Armitage off on some\ncryptic foray, the two of them walking alone past Dam Square\nto a bar she knew on a Damrak thoroughfare. Paris was a\nblurred dream. Shopping. She'd taken him shopping.\nHe stood, pulling on a wrinkled pair of new black jeans that\nlay at his feet, and knelt beside the bags. The first one he\nopened was Molly's: neatly folded clothing and small expen-\nsive-looking gadgets. The second was stuffed with things he\ndidn't remember buying: books, tapes, a Simstim deck, clothing\nwith French and Italian labels. Beneath a green t-shirt, he\ndiscovered a flat, origami-wrapped package, recycled Japanese\npaper.\nThe paper tore when he picked it up; a bright nine-pointed\nstar fell--to stick upright in a crack in the parquet.\n\"Souvenir,\" Molly said. \"I noticed you were always looking\nat 'em.\" He turned and saw her sitting cross legged on the bed,\nsleepily scratching her stomach with burgundy nails.", "\"Someone's coming later to secure the place,\" Armitage\nsaid. He stood in the open doorway with an old-fashioned\nmagnetic key in his hand. Molly was making coffee on a tiny\nGerman stove she took from her bag.\n\"I can do it,\" she said. \"I got enough gear already. Infrascan\nperimeter, screamers...\"\n\"No,\" he said, closing the door. \"I want it tight.\"\n\"Suit yourself.\" She wore a dark mesh t-shirt tucked into\nbaggy black cotton pants.\n\"You ever the heat, Mr. Armitage?\" Case asked, from where\nhe sat, his back against a wall.\nArmitage was no taller than Case, but with his broad shoul-\nders and military posture he seemed to fill the doorway. He\nwore a somber Italian suit; in his right hand he held a briefcase\nof soft black calf. The Special Forces earring was gone. The\nhandsome, inexpressive features offered the routine beauty of\nthe cosmetic boutiques, a conservative amalgam of the past\ndecade's leading media faces. The pale glitter of his eyes\nheightened the effect of a mask. Case began to regret the ques-\ntion.\n\"Lots of Forces types wound up cops, I mean. Or corporate\nsecurity,\" Case added uncomfortably. Molly handed him a\nsteaming mug of coffee. \"That number you had them do on\nmy pancreas, that's like a cop routine.\"\nArmitage closed the door and crossed the room, to stand in\nfront of Case. \"You're a lucky boy, Case. You should thank\nme.\"\n\"Should l?\" Case blew noisily on his coffee.\n\"You needed a new pancreas. The one we bought for you\nfrees you from a dangerous dependency.\"\n\"Thanks, but I was enjoying that dependency.\"\n\"Good, because you have a new one.\"\n\"How's that?\" Case looked up from his coffee. Armitage\nwas smiling.\n\"You have fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of various\nmain arteries, Case. They're dissolving. Very slowly, but they\ndefinitely are dissolving. Each one contains a mycotoxin. You're\nalready familiar with the effect of that mycotoxin. It was the\none your former employers gave you in Memphis.\"\nCase blinked up at the smiling mask.\n\"You have time to do what I'm hiring you for, Case, but\nthat's all. Do the job and I can inject you with an enzyme that\nwill dissolve the bond without opening the sacs. Then you'll\nneed a blood change. Otherwise, the sacs melt and you're back\nwhere I found you. So you see, Case, you need us. You need\nus as badly as you did when we scraped you up from the gutter.\"\nCase looked at Molly. She shrugged.\n\"Now go down to the freight elevator and bring up the cases\nyou find there.\" Armitage handed him the magnetic key. \"Go\non. You'll enjoy this, Case. Like Christmas morning.\"", "Summer in the Sprawl, the mall crowds swaying like wind-\nblown grass, a field of flesh shot through with sudden eddies\nof need and gratification.\nHe sat beside Molly in filtered sunlight on the rim of a dry\nconcrete fountain, letting the endless stream of faces recapi-\ntulate the stages of his life. First a child with hooded eyes, a\nstreet boy, hands relaxed and ready at his sides; then a teenager,\nface smooth and cryptic beneath red glasses. Case remembered\nfighting on a rooftop at seventeen, silent combat in the rose\nglow of the dawn geodesics.\nHe shifted on the concrete, feeling it rough and cool through\nthe thin black denim. Nothing here like the electric dance of\nNinsei. This was different commerce, a different rhythm, in\nthe smell of fast food and perfume and fresh summer sweat.\nWith his deck waiting, back in the loft, an Ono-Sendai\nCyberspace 7. They'd left the place littered with the abstract\nwhite forms of the foam packing units, with crumpled plastic\nfilm and hundreds of tiny foam beads. The Ono-Sendai; next\nyear's most expensive Hosaka computer; a Sony monitor; a\ndozen disks of corporate-grade ice; a Braun coffee maker. Ar-\nmitage had only waited for Case's approval of each piece.\n\"Where'd he go?\" Case had asked Molly.\n\"He likes hotels. Big ones. Near airports, if he can manage\nit. Let's go down to the street.\" She'd zipped herself into an\nold surplus vest with a dozen oddly shaped pockets and put on\na huge pair of black plastic sunglasses that completely covered\nher mirrored insets.\n\"You know about that toxin shit, before?\" he asked her, by\nthe fountain. She shook her head. \"You think it's true?\"\n\"Maybe, maybe not. Works either way.\"\n\"You know any way I can find out?\"\n\"No,\" she said, her right hand coming up to form the jive\nfor silence. \"That kind of kink's too subtle to show up on a\nscan.\" Then her fingers moved again: wait. \"And you don't\ncare that much anyway. I saw you stroking that Sendai; man,\nit was pornographic.\" She laughed.\n\"So what's he got on you? How's he got the working girl\nkinked?\"\n\"-Professional pride, baby, that's all.\" And again the sign\nfor silence. \"We're gonna get some breakfast, okay? Eggs, real\nbacon. Probably kill you, you been eating that rebuilt Chiba\nkrill for so long. Yeah, come on, we'll tube in to Manhattan\nand get us a real breakfast.\"", "Lifeless neon spelled out METRO HOLOGRAFIX in dusty\ncapitals of glass tubing. Case picked at a shred of bacon that\nhad lodged between his front teeth. He'd given up asking her\nwhere they were going and why; jabs in the ribs and the sign\nfor silence were all he'd gotten in reply. She talked about the\nseason's fashions, about sports, about a political scandal in\nCalifornia he'd never heard of.\nHe looked around the deserted dead end street. A sheet of\nnewsprint went cart wheeling past the intersection. Freak winds\nin the East side; something to do with convection, and an\noverlap in the domes. Case peered through the window at the\ndead sign. Her Sprawl wasn't his Sprawl? he decided. She'd\nled him through a dozen bars and clubs he'd never seen before,\ntaking care of business, usually with no more than a nod.\nMaintaining connections.\nSomething was moving in the shadows behind METRO\nHOLOGRAFIX.\nThe door was a sheet of corrugated roofing. In front of it,\nMolly's hands flowed through an intricate sequence of jive that\nhe couldn't follow. He caught the sign for cash, a thumb brush-\ning the tip of the forefinger. The door swung inward and sheled\nhim into the smell of dust. They stood in a clearing, dense\ntangles of junk rising on either side to walls lined with shelves\nof crumbling paperbacks. The junk looked like something that\nhad grown there, a fungus of twisted metal and plastic. He\ncould pick out individual objects, but then they seemed to blur\nback into the mass: the guts of a television so old it was studded\nwith the glass stumps of vacuum tubes, a crumpled dish an-\ntenna, a brown fiber canister stuffed with corroded lengths of\nalloy tubing. An enormous pile of old magazines had cascaded\ninto the open area, flesh of lost summers staring blindly up as\nhe followed her back through a narrow canyon of impacted\nscrap. He heard the door close behind them. He didn't look\nback.\nThe tunnel ended with an ancient Army blanket tacked across\na doorway. White light flooded out as Molly ducked past it.\nFour square walls of blank white plastic, ceiling to match,\nfloored with white hospital tile molded in a non slip pattern of\nsmall raised disks. In the center stood a square, white-painted\nwooden table and four white folding chairs.\nThe man who stood blinking now in the doorway behind\nthem, the blanket draping one shoulder like a cape, seemed to\nhave been designed in a wind tunnel. His ears were very small,\nplastered flat against his narrow skull, and his large front teeth,\nrevealed in something that wasn't quite a smile, were canted\nsharply backward. He wore an ancient tweed jacket and held\na handgun of some kind in his left hand. He peered at them,\nblinked, and dropped the gun into a jacket pocket. He gestured\nto Case, pointed at a slab of white plastic that leaned near the\ndoorway. Case crossed to it and saw that it was a solid sandwich\nof circuitry, nearly a centimeter thick. He helped the man lift\nit and position it in the doorway. Quick, nicotine-stained fingers\nsecured it with a white velcro border. A hidden exhaust fan\nbegan to purr.\n\"Time,\" the man said, straightening up, \"and counting. You\nknow the rate, Moll.\"\n\"We need a scan, Finn. For implants.\"\n\"So get over there between the pylons. Stand on the tape.\nStraighten up, yeah. Now turn around, gimme a full three-\nsixty.\" Case watched her rotate between two fragile-looking\nstands studded with sensors. The man took a small monitor\nfrom his pocket and squinted at it. \"Something new in your\nhead, yeah. Silicon. coat of pyrolitic carbons. A clock, right?\nYour glasses gimme the read they always have, low-temp is-\notropic carbons. Better biocompatibility with pyrolitics, but\nthat's your business, right? Same with your claws.\"\n\"Get over here, Case.\" He saw a scuffed X in black on the\nwhite floor. \"Turn around. Slow.\"\n\"Guy's a virgin.\" The man shrugged. \"Some cheap dental\nwork, is all.\"\n\"You read for biologicals?\" Molly unzipped her green vest\nand took off the dark glasses.\n\"You think this is the Mayo? Climb on the table, kid, we'll\nrun a little biopsy.\" He laughed, showing more of his yellow\nteeth. \"Nah. Finn's word, sweetmeat, you got no little bugs,\nno cortex bombs. You want me to shut the screen down?\"\n\"Just for as long as it takes you to leave, Finn. Then we'll\nwant full screen for as long as we want it.\"\n\"Hey, that's fine by the Finn, Moll. You're only paying by\nthe second.\"\nThey sealed the door behind him and Molly turned one of\nthe white chairs around and sat on it, chin resting on crossed\nforearms. \"We talk now. This is as private as I can afford.\"\n\"What about?\"\n\"What we're doing.\"\n\"What are we doing?\"\n\"Working for Armitage.\"\n\"And you're saying this isn't for his benefit?\"\n\"Yeah. I saw your profile, Case. And I've seen the rest of\nour shopping list, once. You ever work with the dead?\"\n\"No.\" He watched his reflection in her glasses. \"I could, I\nguess. I'm good at what I do.\" The present tense made him\nnervous.\n\"You know that the Dixie Flat line's dead?\"\nHe nodded. \"Heart, I heard.\"\n\"You'll be working with his construct.\" She smiled. \"Taught\nyou the ropes, huh? Him and Ovine. I know Quine, by the\nway. Real ass hole.\"\n\"Somebody's got a recording of McCoy Pauley? Who?\"\nNow Case sat, and rested his elbows on the table. \"I can't see\nit. He'd never have sat still for it.\"\n\"Sense/Net. Paid him mega, you bet your ass.\"\n\"Ovine dead too?\"\n\"No such luck. He's in Europe. He doesn't come into this.\"\n\"Well, if we can get the Flatline, we're home free. He was\nthe best. You know he died brain death three times?\"\nShe nodded.\n\"Flat lined on his EEG. Showed me tapes. 'Boy, I was daid.' \"\n\"Look, Case, I been trying to suss out who it is is backing\nArmitage since I signed on. But it doesn't feel like a zaibatsu,\na government, or some Yakuza subsidiary. Armitage gets or-\nders. Like something tells him to go off to Chiba, pick up a\npillhead who's making one last wobble throught the burnout\nbelt, and trade a program for the operation that'll fix him up.\nWe could a bought twenty world class cowboys for what the\nmarket was ready to pay for that surgical program. You were\ngood, but not that good....\" She scratched the side of her\nnose.\n\"Obviously makes sense to somebody,\" he said. \"Some-\nbody big.\"\n\"Don't let me hurt your feelings.\" She grinned. \"We're\ngonna be pulling one hardcore run, Case, just to get the Flat-\n line's construct.

You gotta jack, I\ngotta tussle.\"\nHe stared at her. \"So tell me what you know about Armi-\ntage.\"\n\"For starters, nobody named Armitage took part in any\nScreaming Fist. I checked. But that doesn't mean much. He\ndoesn't look like any of the pics of the guys who got out.\" She\nshrugged. \"Big deal. And starters is all I got.\" She drummed\nher nails on the back of the chair. \"But you are a cowboy,\naren't you? I mean, maybe you could have a little look around.\"\nShe smiled.\n\"He'd kill me.\"\n\"Maybe. Maybe not. I think he needs you, Case, and real\nbad. Besides, you're a clever john, no? You can winkle him,\nsure.\"\n\"What else is on that list you mentioned?\"\n\"Toys. Mostly for you. And one certified psychopath name\nof Peter Riviera.

Maybe\neasier for you, alone....\" He shook his head.\n\"No. Stay, doesn't matter.\" He settled the black terry sweat-\nband across his forehead, careful not to disturb the flat Sendai\ndermatrodes. He stared at the deck on his lap, not really seeing\nit, seeing instead the shop window on Ninsei, the chromed\nshuriken burning with reflected neon. He glanced up; on the\nwall, just above the Sony, he'd hung her gift, tacking it there\nwith a yellow-headed drawing pin through the hole at its center.\nclosed his eyes.\nFound the ridged face of the power stud.\nAnd in the bloodlit dark behind his eyes, silver phosphenes\nboiling in from the edge of space, hypnagogic images jerking\npast like film compiled from random frames.

He checked the time. He'd been in cyberspace for\nfive hours. He carried the Ono-Sendai to one of the new work-\ntables and collapsed across the bedslab, pulling Molly's black\nsilk sleeping bag over his head.\nThe security package taped to the steel fire door bleeped\ntwice. \"Entry requested,\" it said. \"Subject is cleared per my\nprogram.\"\n\"So open it.\" Case pulled the silk from his face and sat up\nas the door opened, expecting to see Molly or Armitage.\n\"Christ,\" said a hoarse voice, \"I know that bitch can see in\nthe dark....\" A squat figure stepped in and closed the door.\n\"Turn the lights on, okay?\" Case scrambled off the slab and\nfound the old-fashioned switch.\n\"I'm the Finn,\" said the Finn, and made a warning face at\nCase.\n\"Case.\"\n\"Pleased to meecha, I'm sure. I'm doing some hardware\nfor your boss, it looks like.\" The Finn fished a pack of Partagas\nfrom a pocket and lit one. The smell of Cuban tobacco filled\nthe room. He crossed to the worktable and glanced at the Ono-\nSendai. \"Looks stock. Soon fix that. But here is your problem,\nkid.\" He took a filthy manila envelope from inside his jacket,\nflicked ash on the floor, and extracted a featureless black rec-\ntangle from the envelope. \"Goddamn factory prototypes,\" he\nsaid, tossing the thing down on the table. \"Cast 'em into a\nblock of polycarbon, can't get in with a laser without frying\nthe works. Booby-trapped for x-ray, ultrascan, God knows\nwhat else. We'll get in, but there's no rest for the wicked,\nright?\" He folded the envelope with great care and tucked it\naway in an inside pocket.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"It's a flip flop switch, basically. Wire it into your Sendai\nhere, you can access live or recorded Sims Tim without having\nto jack out of the matrix.\"\n\"What for?\"\n\"I haven't got a clue. Know I'm fitting Moll for a broadcast\nrig, though, so it's probably her sensorium you'll access.\" The\nFinn scratched his chin. \"So now you get to find out just how\ntight those jeans really are, huh?\""], "4": ["Case sat in the loft with the dermatrodes strapped across his\nforehead, watching motes dance in the diluted sunlight that\nfiltered through the grid overhead. A countdown was in pro-\ngress in one corner of the monitor screen.\nCowboys didn't get into Simstim, he thought, because it\nwas basically a meat toy. He knew that the trodes he used and\nthe little plastic tiara dangling from a Simstim deck were bas-\nically the same, and that the cyberspace matrix was actually a\ndrastic simplification of the human sensorium, at least in terms\nof presentation, but Simstim itself struck him as a gratuitous\nmultiplication of flesh input. The commercial stuff was edited,\nof course, so that if Tally Isham got a headache in the course\nof a segment, you didn't feel it.\nThe screen bleeped a two-second warning.\nThe new switch was patched into his Sendai with a thin\nribbon of fiber optics.\nAnd one and two and--", "Cyberspace slid into existence from the cardinal points.\nSmooth, he thought, but not smooth enough. Have to work ont....\nThen he keyed the new switch.\nThe abrupt jolt into other flesh. Matrix gone, a wave of\nsound and color.... She was moving through a crowded street,\npast stalls vending discount software, prices felt penned on sheets\nof plastic, fragments of music from countless speakers. Smells\nof urine, free monomers, perfume, patties of frying krill. For\na few frightened seconds he fought helplessly to control her\nbody. Then he willed himself into passivity, became the pas-\nsenger behind her eyes.\nThe glasses didn't seem to cut down the sunlight at all. He\nwondered if the built-in amps compensated automatically. Blue\nalphanumerics winked the time, low in her left peripheral field.\nShowing off, he thought.\nHer body language was disorienting, her style foreign. She\nseemed continually on the verge of colliding with someone,\nbut people melted out of her way, stepped sideways, made\nroom.\n\"How you doing, Case?\" He heard the words and felt her\nform them. She slid a hand into her jacket, a fingertip circling\na nipple under warm silk. The sensation made him catch his\nbreath. She laughed. But the link was one-way. He had no way\nto reply.\nTwo blocks later, she was threading the outskirts of Memory\nLane. Case kept trying to jerk her eyes toward landmarks he\nwould have used to find his way. He began to find the passivity\nof the situation irritating.\nThe transition to cyberspace, when he hit the switch, was\ninstantaneous. He punched himself down a wall of primitive\nice belonging to the New York Public Library, automatically\ncounting potential windows. Keying back into her sensorium,\ninto the sinuous flow of muscle, senses sharp and bright.\nHe found himself wondering about the mind he shared these\nsensations with. What did he know about her? That she was\nanother professional; that she said her being, like his, was the\nthing she did to make a living. He knew the way she'd moved\nagainst him, earlier, when she woke, their mutual grunt of\nunity when he'd entered her, and that she liked her coffee black,\nafterward....\nHer destination was one of the dubious software rental com-\nplexes that lined Memory Lane. There was a stillness, a hush.\nBooths lined a central hall. The clientele were young, few of\nthem out of their teens. They all seemed to have carbon sockets\nplanted behind the left ear, but she didn't focus on them. The\ncounters that fronted the booths displayed hundreds of slivers\nof microsoft, angular fragments of colored silicon mounted\nunder oblong transparent bubbles on squares of white card-\nboard. Molly went to the seventh booth along the south wall.\nBehind the counter a boy with a shaven head stared vacantly\ninto space, a dozen spikes of microsoft protruding from the\nsocket behind his ear.\n\"Larry, you in, man?\" She positioned herself in front of\nhim. The boy's eyes focused. He sat up in his chair and pried\na bright magenta splinter from his socket with a dirty thumbnail .\n\"Hey, Larry.\"\n\"Molly.\" He nodded.\n\"I have some work for some of your friends, Larry.\"\nLarry took a flat plastic case from the pocket of his red\nsport shirt and flicked it open, slotting the microsoft beside a\ndozen others. His hand hovered, selected a glossy black chip\nthat was slightly longer than the rest, and inserted it smoothly\ninto his head. His eyes narrowed.\n\"Molly's got a rider,\" he said, \"and Larry doesn't like that.\"\n\"Hey,\" she said, \"I didn't know you were so . . . sensitive.\nI'm impressed. Costs a lot, to get that sensitive.\"\n\"I know you, lady?\" The blank look returned. \"You looking\nto buy some softs?\"\n\"I'm looking for the Moderns.\"\n\"You got a rider, Molly. This says.\" He tapped the black\nsplinter. \"Somebody else using your eyes.\"\n\"My partner.\"\n\"Tell your partner to go.\"\n\"Got something for the Panther Moderns, Larry.\"\n\"What are you talking about, lady?\"\n\"Case, you take off,\" she said, and he hit the switch, in-\nstantly back in the matrix. Ghost impressions of the software\ncomplex hung for a few seconds in the buzzing calm of cy-\nberspace.\n\"Panther Moderns,\" he said to the Hosaka, removing the\ntrodes. \"Five minute precis.\"\n\"Ready,\" the computer said.\nIt wasn't a name he knew. Something new, something that\nhad come in since he'd been in Chiba. Fads swept the youth\nof the Spraw] at the speed of light; entire subcultures could rise\novernight, thrive for a dozen weeks, and then vanish utterly.\n\"Go,\" he said. The Hosaka had accessed its array of libraries,\njournals, and news services.\nThe precis began with a long hold on a color still that Case\nat first assumed was a collage of some kind, a boy's face\nsnipped from another image and glued to a photograph of a\npaint-scrawled wall. Dark eyes, epicanthic folds obviously the\nresult of surgery, an angry dusting of acne across pale narrow\ncheeks. The Hosaka released the freeze; the boy moved, flow-\ning with the sinister grace of a mime pretending to be a jungle\npredator. His body was nearly invisible, an abstract pattern\napproximating the scribbled brickwork sliding smoothly across\nhis tight one piece. Mimetic polycarbon.\nCut to Dr. Virginia Rambali, Sociology, NYU, her name,\nfaculty, and school pulsing across the screen in pink alphanu-\nmerics.\n\"Given their penchant for these random acts of surreal vi-\nolence,\" someone said, \"it may be difficult for our viewers to\nunderstand why you continue to insist that this phenomenon\nisn't a form of terrorism.\"\nDr. RamBali smiled. \"There is always a point at which the\nterrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt. A point at\nwhich the violence may well escalate, but beyond which the\nterrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself.\nTerrorism as we ordinarily understand it is inately media-re-\nlated. The Panther Moderns differ from other terrorists pre-\ncisely in their degree of self-consciousness, in their awareness\nof the extent to which media divorce the act of terrorism from\nthe original sociopolitical intent....\"\n\"Skip it,\" Case said.", "Case met his first Modern two days after he'd screened the\nHosaka's precis. The Moderns, he'd decided, were a contem-\nporary version of the Big Scientists of his own late teens. There\nwas a kind of ghostly teenage DNA at work in the Sprawl,\nsomething that carried the coded precepts of various short-lived\nsub cults and replicated them at odd intervals. The Panther Mod-\nerns were a soft head variant on the Scientists. If the technology\nhad been available the Big Scientists would all have had sock-\nets stuffed with microsofts. It was the style that mattered and\nthe style was the same. The Moderns were mercenaries, prac-\ntical jokers, nihilistic technofetishists.\nThe one who showed up at the loft door with a box of\ndiskettes from the Finn was a soft-voiced boy called Angelo.\nHis face was a simple graft grown on collagen and shark-\n cartilage polysaccharides, smooth and hideous. It was one of\nthe nastiest pieces of elective surgery Case had ever seen. When\nAngelo smiled, revealing the razor-sharp canines of some large\nanimal, Case was actually relieved. Tooth bud transplants. He'd\nseen that before.\n\"You can't let the little pricks generation-gap you,\" Molly\nsaid. Case nodded, absorbed in the patterns of the Sense/Net\nice.\nThis was it. This was what he was, who he was, his being.\nHe forgot to eat. Molly left cartons of rice and foam trays of\nsushi on the corner of the long table. Sometimes he resented\nhaving to leave the deck to use the chemical toilet they'd set\nup in a corner of the loft. Ice patterns formed and reformed on\nthe screen as he probed for gaps, skirted the most obvious\ntraps, and mapped the route he'd take through Sense/Net's ice.\nIt was good ice. Wonderful ice. Its patterns burned there while\nhe lay with his arm under Molly's shoulders, watching the red\ndawn through the steel grid of the skylight. Its rainbow pixel\nmaze was the first thing he saw when he woke. He'd go straight\nto the deck, not bothering to dress, and jack in. He was cutting\nit. He was working. He lost track of days.\nAnd sometimes, falling asleep, particularly when Molly was\noff on one of her reconnaissance trips with her rented cadre of\nModerns, images of Chiba came flooding back. Faces and\nNinsei neon. Once he woke from a confused dream of Linda\nLee, unable to recall who she was or what she'd ever meant\nto him. When he did remember, he jacked in and worked for\nnine straight hours.\nThe cutting of Sense/Net's ice took a total of nine days.\n\"I said a week,\" Armitage said, unable to conceal his sat-\nisfaction when Case showed him his plan for the run. \"You\ntook your own good time.\"\n\"Balls,\" Case said, smiling at the screen. \"That's good work,\nArmitage.\"\n\"Yes,\" Armitage admitted, \"but don't let it go to your head.\nCompared to what you'll eventually be up against, this is an\narcade toy.\"", "\"Love you, Cat Mother,\" whispered the Panther Modern's\nlink man. His voice was modulated static in Case's headset.\n\"Atlanta, Brood. Looks go. Go, got it?\" Molly's voice was\nslightly clearer.\n\"To hear is to obey.\" The Moderns were using some kind\nof chicken wire dish in New Jersey to bounce the link man's\nscrambled signal off a Sons of Christ the King satellite in\ngeosynchronous orbit above Manhattan. They chose to regard\nthe entire operation as an elaborate private joke, and their\nchoice of comsats seemed to have been deliberate. Molly's\nsignals were being beamed up from a one-meter umbrella dish\nepoxy-ed to the roof of a black glass bank tower nearly as tall\nas the Sense/Net building.\nAtlanta. The recognition code was simple. Atlanta to Boston\nto Chicago to Denver, five minutes for each city. If anyone\nmanaged to intercept Molly's signal, unscramble it, synth her\nvoice, the code would tip the Moderns. If she remained in the\nbuilding for more than twenty minutes, it was highly unlikely\nshe'd be coming out at all.\nCase gulped the last of his coffee, settled the trodes in place,\nand scratched his chest beneath his black t-shirt. He had only\na vague idea of what the Panther Moderns planned as a diver-\nsion for the Sense/Net security people. His job was to make\nsure the intrusion program he'd written would link with the\nSense/Net systems when Molly needed it to. He watched the\ncountdown in the corner of the screen. Two. One.\nHe jacked in and triggered his program. \"Mainline,\" breathed\nthe link man, his voice the only sound as Case plunged through\nthe glowing strata of Sense/Net ice. Good. Check Molly. He\nhit the Simstim and flipped into her sensorium.\nThe scrambler blurred the visual input slightly. She stood\nbefore a wall of gold-flecked mirror in the building's vast white\nlobby, chewing gum, apparently fascinated by her own reflec-\ntion. Aside from the huge pair of sunglasses concealing her\nmirrored insets, she managed to look remarkably like she\nbelonged there, another tourist girl hoping for a glimpse of\nTally Isham. She wore a pink plastic raincoat, a white mesh\ntop, loose white pants cut in a style that had been fashionable\nin Tokyo the previous year. She grinned vacantly and popped\nher gum. Case felt like laughing. He could feel the micro pore\ntape across her ribcage, feel the flat little units under it: the\nradio, the Simstim unit, and the scrambler. The throat mike,\nglued to her neck, looked as much as possible like an analgesic\ndermadisk. Her hands, in the pockets of the pink coat, were\nflexing systematically through a series of tension-release ex-\nercises. It took him a few seconds to realize that the peculiar\nsensation at the tips of her fingers was caused by the blades as\nthey were partially extruded, then retracted.\nHe flipped back. His program had reached the fifth gate.\nHe watched as his icebreaker strobed and shifted in front of\nhim, only faintly aware of his hands playing across the deck,\nmaking minor adjustments. Translucent planes of color shuffled\nlike a trick deck. Take a card, he thought, any card.\nThe gate blurred past. He laughed. The Sense/Net ice had\naccepted his entry as a routine transfer from the consortium's\nLos Angeles complex. He was inside. Behind him, viral sub-\nprograms peeled off, meshing with the gate' s code fabric, ready\nto deflect the real Los Angeles data when it arrived.\nHe flipped again. Molly was strolling past the enormous\ncircular reception desk at the rear of the lobby.\n12:01:20 as the readout flared in her optic nerve.", "At midnight, synch Ed with the chip behind Molly's eye, the\nlink man in Jersey had given his command. \"Mainline.\" Nine\nModerns, scattered along two hundred miles of the Sprawl,\nhad simultaneously dialed MAX EMERG from pay phones.\nEach Modern delivered a short set speech, hung up, and drifted\nout into the night, peeling off surgical gloves. Nine different\npolice departments and public security agencies were absorbing\nthe information that an obscure sub sect of militant Christian\nfundamentalists had just taken credit for having introduced\nclinical levels of an outlawed psychoactive agent known as\nBlue Nine into the ventilation system of the Sense/Net Pyramid.\nBlue Nine, known in California as Grievous Angel, had been\nshown to produce acute paranoia and homicidal psychosis in\neighty-five percent of experimental subjects.", "Case hit the switch as his program surged through the gates\nof the subsystem that controlled security for the Sense/Net\nresearch library. He found himself stepping into an elevator.\n\"Excuse me, but are you an employee?\" The guard raised\nhis eyebrows. Molly popped her gum. \"No,\" she said, driving\nthe first two knuckles of her right hand into the man's solar\nplexus. As he doubled over, clawing for the beeper on his belt\nshe slammed his head sideways, against the wall of the elevator.\nChewing a little more rapidly now, she touched CLOSE\nDOOR and STOP on the illuminated panel. She took a black box\nfrom her coat pocket and inserted a lead in the keyhole of the\nlock that secured the panel's circuitry.", "The Panther Moderns allowed four minutes for their first\nmove to take effect, then injected a second carefully prepared\ndose of misinformation. This time, they shot it directly into\nthe Sense/Net building's internal video system.\nAt 12:04:03, every screen in the building strobed for eigh-\nteen seconds in a frequency that produced seizures in a sus-\nceptible segment of Sense/Net employees. Then something only\nvaguely like a human face filled the screens, its features stretched\nacross asymmetrical expanses of bone like some obscene Mer-\ncator projection. Blue lips parted wetly as the twisted, elongated\njaw moved. Something, perhaps a hand, a thing like a reddish\nclump of gnarled roots, fumbled toward the camera, blurred,\nand vanished. Subliminally rapid images of contamination:\ngraphics of the building's water supply system, gloved hands\nmanipulating laboratory glassware, something tumbling down\ninto darkness, a pale splash.... The audio track, its pitch ad-\njusted to run at just less than twice the standard playback speed,\nwas part of a month-old newscast detailing potential military\nuses of a substance known as HsG, a biochemical governing\nthe human skeletal growth factor. Overdoses of HsG threw\ncertain bone cells into overdrive, accelerating growth by factors\nas high as one thousand percent.\nAt 12:05:00, the mirror-sheathed nexus of the Sense/Net\nconsortium held just over three thousand employees. At five\nminutes after midnight, as the Modems' message ended in a\nflare of white screen, the Sense/Net Pyramid screamed.\nHalf a dozen NYPD Tactical hovercraft, responding to the\npossibility of Blue Nine in the building's ventilation system,\nwere converging on the Sense/Net Pyramid. They were running\nfull riot lights. A BAMA Rapid Deployment helicopter was\nlifting off from its pad on Riker's.", "Case triggered his second program. A carefully engineered\nvirus attacked the code fabric screening primary custodial com-\nmands for the sub-basement that housed the Sense/Net research\nmaterials. \"Boston,\" Molly's voice came across the link, \"I'm\ndownstairs.\" Case switched and saw the blank wall of the\nelevator. She was unzipping the white pants. A bulky packet,\nexactly the shade of her pale ankle, was secured there with\nmicro pore. She knelt and peeled the tape away. Streaks of\nburgundy flickered across the mimetic polycarbon as she un-\nfolded the Modem suit. She removed the pink raincoat, threw\nit down beside the white pants, and began to pull the suit on\nover the white mesh top.\n12:06:26.\nCase's virus had bored a window through the library's com-\nmand ice. He punched himself through and found an infinite\nblue space ranged with color-coded spheres strung on a tight\ngrid of pale blue neon. In the non space of the matrix, the interior\nof a given data construct possessed unlimited subjective di-\nmension; a child's toy calculator, accessed through Case's Sen-\ndai, would have presented limitless gulfs of nothingness hung\nwith a few basic commands. Case began to key the sequence\nthe Finn had purchased from a mid-eschelon sarariman with\nsevere drug problems. He began to glide through the spheres\nas if he were on invisible tracks.\nHere. This one.\nPunching his way into the sphere, chill blue neon vault above\nhim starless and smooth as frosted glass, he triggered a sub-\nprogram that effected certain alterations in the core custodial\ncommands.\nOut now. Reversing smoothly, the virus reknitting the fabric\nof the window.\nDone.", "In the Sense/Net lobby, two Panther Moderns sat alertly\nbehind a low rectangular planter, taping the riot with a video\ncamera. They both wore chameleon suits. \"Tacticals are spray-\ning foam barricades now,\" one noted, speaking for the benefit\nof his throat mike. \"Rapids are still trying to land their copter.\"", "Case hit the Sims Tim switch. And flipped into the agony of\nbroken bone. Molly was braced against the blank gray wall of\na long corridor, her breath coming ragged and uneven. Case\nwas back in the matrix instantly, a white-hot line of pain fading\nin his left thigh.\n\"What's happening, Brood?\" he asked the link man.\n\"I dun no, Cutter. Mother's not talking. Wait.\"\nCase's program was cycling. A single hair-fine thread of\ncrimson neon extended from the center of the restored window\nto the shifting outline of his icebreaker. He didn't have time\nto wait. Taking a deep breath, he flipped again.\nMolly took a single step, trying to support her weight on\nthe corridor wall. In the loft, Case groaned. The second step\ntook her over an outstretched arm. Uniform sleeve bright with\nfresh blood. Glimpse of a shattered fiberglass shock stave. Her\nvision seemed to have narrowed to a tunnel. With the third\nstep, Case screamed and found himself back in the matrix.\n\"Brood? Boston, baby. . .\" Her voice tight with pain. She\ncoughed. \"Little problem with the natives. Think one of them\nbroke my leg.\"\n\"What you need now, Cat Mother?\" The link man's voice\nwas indistinct, nearly lost behind static.\nCase forced himself to flip back. She was leaning against\nthe wall, taking all of her weight on her right leg. She fumbled\nthrough the contents of the suit's kangaroo pocket and withdrew\na sheet of plastic studded with a rainbow of dermadisks. She\nselected three and thumbed them hard against her left wrist,\nover the veins. Six thousand micrograms of endorphin analog\ncame down on the pain like a hammer, shattering it. Her back\narched convulsively. Pink waves of warmth lapped up her thighs.\nShe sighed and slowly relaxed.\n\"Okay, Brood. Okay now. But I'll need a medical team\nwhen l come out. Tell my people. Cutter, I'm two minutes\nfrom target. Can you hold?\"\n\"Tell her I'm in and holding,\" Case said.\nMolly began to limp down the corridor. When she glanced\nback, once, Case saw the crumpled bodies of three Sense/Net\nsecurity guards. One of them seemed to have no eyes.\n\"Tacticals and Rapids have sealed the ground floor, Cat\nMother. Foam barricades. Lobby's getting juicy.\"\n\"Pretty juicy down here,\" she said, swinging herself through\na pair of gray steel doors. \"Almost there, Cutter.\"\nCase flipped into the matrix and pulled the trodes from his\nforehead. He was drenched with sweat. He wiped his forehead\nwith a towel, took a quick sip of water from the bicycle bottle\nbeside the Hosaka, and checked the map of the library displayed\non the screen. A pulsing red cursor crept through the outline\nof a doorway. Only millimeters from the green dot that indi-\ncated the location of the Dixie Flat line's construct. He won-\ndered what it was doing to her leg, to walk on it that way.\nWith enough endorphin analog, she could walk on a pair of\nbloody stumps. He tightened the nylon harness that held him\nin the chair and replaced the trodes.\nRoutine now: trodes, jack, and flip.\nThe Sense/Net research library was a dead storage area; the\nmaterials stored here had to be physically removed before they\ncould be interfaced. Molly hobbled between rows of identical\ngray lockers.\n\"Tell her five more and ten to her left, Brood,\" Case said.\n\"Five more and ten left, Cat Mother,\" the link man said.\nShe took the left. A white-faced librarian cowered between\ntwo lockers, her cheeks wet, eyes blank. Molly ignored her.\nCase wondered what the Moderns had done to provoke that\nlevel of terror. He knew it had something to do with a hoaxed\nthreat, but he' d been too involved with his ice to follow Molly ' s\nexplanation.\n\"That's it,\" Case said, but she'd already stopped in front of\nthe cabinet that held the construct. Its lines reminded Case of\nthe Neo-Aztec bookcases in Julie Deane's anteroom in Chiba.\n\"Do it, Cutter,\" Molly said.\nCase flipped to cyberspace and sent a command pulsing\ndown the crimson thread that pierced the library ice. Five sep-\narate alarm systems were convinced that they were still oper-\native. The three elaborate locks deactivated, but considered\nthemselves to have remained locked. The library's central bank\nsuffered a minute shift in its permanent memory: the construct\nhad been removed, per executive order, a month before. Check-\ning for the authorization to remove the construct, a librarian\nwould find the records erased.\nThe door swung open on silent hinges.\n\"0467839,\" Case said, and Molly drew a black storage unit\nfrom the rack. It resembled the magazine of a large assault\nrifle, its surfaces covered with warning decals and security\nratings.\nMolly closed the locker door; Case flipped.\nHe withdrew the line through the library ice. It whipped\nback into his program, automatically triggering a full system\nreversal. The Sense/Net gates snapped past him as he backed\nout, subprograms whirling back into the core of the icebreaker\nas he passed the gates where they had been stationed.\n\"Out, Brood,\" he said, and slumped in his chair. After the\nconcentration of an actual run, he could remain jacked in and\nstill retain awareness of his body. It might take Sense/Net days\nto discover the theft of the construct. The key would be the\ndeflection of the Los Angeles transfer, which coincided too\nneatly with the Modern's terror run. He doubted that the three\nsecurity men Molly had encountered in the corridor would live\nto talk about it. He flipped.\nThe elevator, with Molly's black box taped beside the control\npanel, remained where she'd left it. The guard still lay curled\non the floor. Case noticed the term on his neck for the first\ntime. Something of Molly's, to keep him under. She stepped\nover him and removed the black box before punching LOBBY.\nAs the elevator door hissed open, a woman hurtled backward\nout of the crowd, into the elevator, and struck the rear wall\nwith her head. Molly ignored her, bending over to peel the\nderm from the guard's neck. Then she kicked the white pants\nand the pink raincoat out the door, tossing the dark glasses\nafter them, and drew the hood of her suit down across her\nforehead. The construct, in the suit's kangaroo pocket, dug\ninto her sternum when she moved. She stepped out.\nCase had seen panic before, but never in an enclosed area.\nThe Sense/Net employees, spilling out of the elevators, had\nsurged for the street doors, only to meet the foam barricades\nof the Tacticals and the sandbag-guns of the BAMA Rapids.\nThe two agencies, convinced that they were containing a horde\nof potential killers, were cooperating with an uncharacteristic\ndegree of efficiency. Beyond the shattered wreckage of the\nmain street doors, bodies were piled three deep on the barri-\ncades. The hollow thumping of the riot guns provided a constant\nbackground for the sound the crowd made as it surged back\nand forth across the lobby's marble floor. Case had never heard\nanything like that sound.\nNeither, apparently, had Molly. \"Jesus,\" she said, and hes-\nitated. It was a sort of keening, rising into a bubbling wail of\nMW and total fear. The lobby floor was covered with bodies,\nclothing, blood, and long trampled scrolls of yellow printout.\n\"C'mon, sister. We're for out. \" The eyes of the two Moderns\nstared out of madly swirling shades of polycarbon, their suits\nunable to keep up with the confusion of shape and color that\nraged behind them. \"You hurt? C'mon. Tommy'll walk you.\"\nTommy handed something to the one who spoke, a video cam-\n EM wrapped in polycarbon.\n\"Chicago,\" she said, \"I'm on my way.\" And then she was\nfalling, not to the marble floor, slick with blood and vomit,\nbut down some blood warm well, into silence and the dark.", "The Panther Modern leader, who introduced himself as Lu-\npus Yonderboy, wore a polycarbon suit with a recording feature\nthat allowed him to replay backgrounds at will. Perched on the\nedge of Case's worktable like some kind of state of the art\ngargoyle, he regarded Case and Armitage with hooded eyes.\nHe smiled. His hair was pink. A rainbow forest of microsofts\nbristled behind his left ear; the ear was pointed, tufted with\nmore pink hair. His pupils had been modified to catch the light\nlike a cat's. Case watched the suit crawl with color and texture.\n\"You let it getout of control,\" Armitage said. He stood in\nthe center of the loft like a statue, wrapped in the dark glossy\nfolds of an expensive-looking trench coat.\n\"Chaos, Mr. Who,\" Lupus Yonderboy said. \"That is our\nmode and mod us. That is our central kick. Your woman knows.\nWe deal with her. Not with you, Mr. Who.\" His suit had taken\non a weird angular pattern of beige and pale avocado. \"She\nneeded her medical team. She's with them. We'll watch out\nfor her. Everything's fine.\" He smiled again.\n\"Pay him,\" Case said.\nArmitage glared at him. \"We don't have the goods.\"\n\"Your woman has it,\" Yonderboy said.\n\"Pay him.\"\nArmitage crossed stiffly to the table and took three fat bun-\ndles of New Yen from the pockets of his trench coat. \"You\nwant to count it?\" he asked Yonder boy.\n\"No,\" the Panther Modern said. \"You'll pay. You're a Mr.\nWho. You pay to stay one. Not a Mr. Name.\"\n\"I hope that isn't a threat,\" Armitage said.\n\"That's business,\" said Yonderboy, stuffing the money into\nthe single pocket on the front of his suit.\nThe phone rang. Case answered.\n\"Molly,\" he told Armitage, handing him the phone.", "The Sprawl's geodesics were lightening into predawn gray\nas Case left the building. His limbs felt cold and disconnected.\nHe couldn't sleep. He was sick of the loft. Lupus had gone,\nthen Armitage, and Molly was in surgery somewhere. Vibration\nbeneath his feet as a train hissed past. Sirens Doppler Ed in the\ndistance.\nHe took corners at random, his collar up, hunched in a new\nleather jacket, flicking the first of a chain of Yeheyuans into\nthe gutter and lighting another. He tried to imagine Armitage's\ntoxin sacs dissolving in his bloodstream, microscopic mem-\nbranes wearing thinner as he walked. It didn't seem real. Nei-\nther did the fear and agony he'd seen through Molly's eyes in\nthe lobby of Sense/Net. He found himself trying to remember\nthe faces of the three people he'd killed in Chiba. The men\nwere blanks; the woman reminded him of Linda Lee. A battered\ntricycle-truck with mirrored windows bounced past him, empty\nplastic cylinders rattling in its bed.\n\"Case.\"\nHe darted sideways, instinctively getting a wall behind his\nback.\n\"Message for you, Case.\" Lupus Yonder boy's suit cycled\nthrough pure primaries. \"Pardon. Not to startle you.\"\nCase straightened up, hands in jacket pockets. He was a\nhead taller than the Modern. \"You ought a be careful, Yon-\nder boy.\"\n\"This is the message. Winter mute.\" He spelled it out.\n\"From you?\" Case took a step forward.\n\"No,\" Yonderboy said. \"For you.\"\n\"Who from?\"\n\"Winter mute,\" Yonderboy repeated, nodding, bobbing his\ncrest of pink hair.

No. There.\nHood up to hide the pink, the suit exactly the right shade of\ngray, mottled and stained as the sidewalk he stood on. The\neyes winked back the red of a stoplight.

The\nbuilding was modular, like some giant version of Cheap Hotel\neach coffin forty meters long. Case met Molly as she emerged\nfrom one that wore the elaborately worked logo of one GER-\nALD CHIN, DENTIST. She was limping.\n\"He says if I kick anything, it'll fall off.\"\n\"I ran into one of your pals,\" he said, \"a Modern.\"\n\"Yeah? Which one?\"\n\"Lupus Yonderboy.

Case had learned\nnot to ask questions; they only brought the sign for silence.\nHer leg seemed to be bothering her, and she seldom spoke.\nA thin black child with wooden beads and antique resistors\nwoven tightly into her hair opened the Finn's door and led them\nalong the tunnel of refuse. Case felt the stuff had grown some-\nhow during their absence . Or else it seemed that it was changing\nsubtly, cooking itself down under the pressure of time, silent\ninvisible flakes settling to form a mulch, a crystalline essence\nof discarded technology, flowering secretly in the Sprawl's\nwaste places.\nBeyond the army blanket, the Finn waited at the white table.\nMolly began to sign rapidly, produced a scrap of paper,\nwrote something on it, and passed it to the Finn. He took it\nbetween thumb and forefinger, holding it away from his body\nas though it might explode. He made a sign Case didn't know,\none that conveyed a mixture of impatience and glum resigna-\ntion. He stood up, brushing crumbs from the front of his bat-\ntered tweed jacket. A glass jar of pickled herring stood on the\ntable beside a torn plastic package of flatbread and a tin ashtray\npiled with the butts of Partagas.\n\"Wait,\" the Finn said, and left the room.\nMolly took his place, extruded the blade from her index\nfinger, and speared a grayish slab of herring. Case wandered\naimlessly around the room, fingering the scanning gear on the\npylons as he passed.\nTen minutes and the Finn came bustling back, showing his\nteeth in a wide yellow smile. He nodded, gave Molly a thumbs-\nup salute, and gestured to Case to help him with the door panel.\nWhile Case smoothed the velcro border into place, the Finn\ntook a flat little console from his pocket and punched out an\nelaborate sequence.\n\"Honey,\" he said to Molly, tucking the console away, \"you\nhave got it. No shit, I can smell it. You wanna tell me where\nyou got it?\"\n\"Yonderboy,\" Molly said, shoving the herring and crackers\naside. \"I did a deal with Larry, on the side.\"\n\"Smart,\" the Finn said. \"It's an AI.\"\n\"Slow it down a little,\" Case said.\n\"Berne,\" the Finn said, ignoring him. \"Berne. It's got lim-\nited Swiss citizenship under their equivalent of the Act of '53.\nBuilt for Tessier-Ashpool S.A. They own the mainframe and\nthe original software.\"\n\"What's in Beme, okay?\" Case deliberately stepped between\nthem.\n\"Wintermute is the recognition code for an AI. I've got the\nTuring Registry numbers. Artificial intelligence.\"\n\"That's all just fine,\" Molly said, \"but where's it get us?\"\n\"If Yonderboy's right,\" the Finn said, \"this Al is backing\nArmitage.\"\n\"I paid Larry to have the Modems nose around Ammitage a\nlittle,\" Molly explained, turning to Case. \"They have some\nvery weird lines of communication. Deal was, they'd get my\nmoney if they answered one question: who's running Armi-\ntage?\"\n\"And you think it's this Al? Those things aren't allowed\nany autonomy. It'll be the parent corporation, this Tessle. . .\"\n\"Tessier-Ashpool S.A.,\" said the Finn. \"And I got a little\nstory for you about them. Wanna hear?\" He sat down and\nhunched forward.\n\"Finn,\" Molly said. \"He loves a story.\"\n\"Haven't ever told anybody this one,\" the Finn began.", "The Finn was a fence, a trafficker in stolen goods, primarily\nin software. In the course of his business, he sometimes came\ninto contact with other fences, some of whom dealt in the more\ntraditional articles of the trade. In precious metals, stamps, rare\ncoins, gems, jewelry, furs, and paintings and other works of\nart. The story he told Case and Molly began with another man's\nstory, a man he called Smith.\nSmith was also a fence, but in balmier seasons he surfaced\nas an art dealer. He was the first person the Finn had known\nwho'd \"gone silicon\"--the phrase had an old-fashioned ring\nfor Case--and the microsofts he purchased were art history\nprograms and tables of gallery sales. With half a dozen chips\nin his new socket, Smith's knowledge of the art business was\nformidable, at least by the standards of his colleagues. But\nSmith had come to the Finn with a request for help, a fraternal\nrequest, one businessman to another. He wanted a go-to on the\nTessier-Ashpool clan, he said, and it had to be executed in a\nway that would guarantee the impossibility of the subject ever\ntracing the inquiry to its source. It might be possible, the Finn\nhad opined, but an explanation was definitely required. \"It\nsmelled,\" the Finn said to Case, \"smelled of money. And Smith\nwas being very careful. Almost too careful.\"\nSmith, it developed, had had a supplier known as Jimmy.\nJimmy was a burglar and other things as well, and just back\nfrom a year in high orbit, having carried certain things back\ndown the gravity well. The most unusual thing Jimmy had\nmanaged to score on his swing through the archipelago was a\nhead, an intricately worked bust, cloisonne over platinum, stud-\nded with seedpearls and lapis. Smith, sighing, had put down\nhis pocket microscope and advised Jimmy to melt the thing\ndown. It was contemporary, not an antique, and had no value\nto the collector. Jimmy laughed. The thing was a computer\nterminal, he said. It could talk. And not in a synth-voice, but\nwith a beautiful arrangement of gears and miniature organ pipes.\nIt was a baroque thing for anyone to have constructed, a per-\nverse thing, because synth-voice chips cost next to nothing. It\nwas a curiosity. Smith jacked the head into his computer and\nlistened as the melodious, inhuman voice piped the figures of\nlast year's tax return.\nSmith' s clientele included a Tokyo billionaire whose passion\nfor clockwork automata approached fetishism. Smith shrugged,\nshowing Jimmy his upturned palms in a gesture old as pawn\nshops. He could try, he said, but he doubted he could get much\nfor it.\nWhen Jimmy had gone, leaving the head, Smith went over\nit carefully, discovering certain hallmarks. Eventually he'd been\nable to trace it to an unlikely collaboration between two Zurich\nartisans, an enamel specialist in Paris, a Dutch jeweler, and a\nCalifornia chip designer. It had been commissioned, he dis-\ncovered, by Tessier-Ashpool S.A.\nSmith began to make preliminary passes at the Tokyo col-\nlector, hinting that he was on the track of something notewor-\nthy.\nAnd then he had a visitor, a visitor unannounced, one who\nwalked in through the elaborate maze of Smith's security as\nthough it didn't exist. A small man, Japanese, enormously\npolite, who bore all the marks of a vatgrown ninja assassin.\nSmith sat very still, staring into the calm brown eyes of death\nacross a polished table of Vietnamese rosewood. Gently, almost\napologetically, the cloned killer explained that it was his duty\nto find and return a certain artwork, a mechanism of great\nbeauty, which had been taken from the house of his master. It\nhad come to his attention, the ninja said, that Smith might\nknow of the whereabouts of this object.\nSmith told the man that he had no wish to die, and produced\nthe head. And how much, his visitor asked did you expect to\nobtain through the sale of this object? Smith named a figure\nfar lower than the price he'd intended to set. The ninja produced\na credit chip and keyed Smith that amount out of a numbered\nSwiss account. And who, the man asked, brought you this\npiece? Smith told him. Within days, Smith learned of Jimmy's\ndeath.\n\"So that was where I came in,\" the Finn continued. \"Smith\nknew I dealt a lot with the Memory Lane crowd, and that's\nwhere you go for a quiet go-to that'll never be traced. I hired\na cowboy. I was the cut-out, so I took a percentage. Smith,\nhe was careful. He'd just had a very weird business experience\nand he'd come out on top, but it didn't add up. Who'd paid,\nout of that Swiss stash? Yakuza? No way. They got a very\nrigid code covers situations like that, and they kill the receiver\ntoo, always. Was it spook stuff? Smith didn't think so. Spook\nbiz has a vibe, you get so you can smell it. Well, I had my\ncowboy buzz the news morgues until we found Tessier-Ashpool\nin litigation. The case wasn't anything, but we got the law\nfirm. Then he did the lawyer's ice and we got the family\naddress. Lotta good it did us.\"\nCase raised his eyebrows.\n\"Freeside,\" the Finn said. \"The spindle. Turns out they own\ndamn near the whole thing. The interesting stuff was the picture\nwe got when the cowboy ran a regular go-to on the news\nmorgues and compiled a precis. Family organization. Corporate\nstructure. Supposedly you can buy into an S.A., but there hasn't\nbeen a share of Tessier-Ashpool traded on the open market in\nover a hundred years. On any market, as far as I know. You're\nlooking at a very quiet, very eccentric first-generation high-\norbit family, run like a corporation. Big money, very shy of\nmedia. Lot of cloning. Orbital law's a lot softer on genetic\nengineering, right? And it's hard to keep track of which gen-\neration, or combination of generations, is running the show at\na given time.\"\n\"How's that?\" Molly asked.\n\"Got their own cryogenic setup. Even under orbital law,\nyou're legally dead for the duration of a freeze. Looks like\nthey trade off, though nobody's seen the founding father in\nabout thirty years. Founding momma, she died in some lab\naccident....\"\n\"So what happened with your fence?\"\n\"Nothing.\" The Finn frowned. \"Dropped it. We had a look\nat this fantastic tangle of powers of attorney the T-A's have,\nand that was it. Jimmy must've gotten into Straylight, lifted\nthe head, and Tessier-Ashpool sent their ninja after it. Smith\ndecided to forget about it. Maybe he was smart.\" He looked\nat Molly. \"The Villa Straylight. Tip of the spindle. Strictly\nprivate.\"\n\"You figure they own that ninja, Finn?\" Molly asked.\n\"Smith thought so.\"\n\"Expensive,\" she said. \"Wonder whatever happened to that\nlittle ninja, Finn?\"\n\"Probably got him on ice. Thaw when needed.\"\n\"Okay,\" Case said, \"we got Armitage getting his goodies\noff an AI named Wintermute. Where's that get us?\"\n\"Nowhere yet,\" Molly said, \"but you got a little side gig\nnow.\" She drew a folded scrap of paper from her pocket and\nhanded it to him. He opened it. Grid coordinates and entry\ncodes.\n\"Who's this?\"\n\"Armitage. Some data base of his. Bought it from the Mod-\nerns. Separate deal. Where is it?\"\n\"London,\" Case said.\n\"Crack it.\" She laughed. \"Earn your keep for a change.\"", "Case waited for a trans-BAMA local on the crowded plat-\nform. Molly had gone back to the loft hours ago, the Flatline's\nconstruct in her green bag, and Case had been drinking steadily\never since.\nIt was disturbing to think of the Flatline as a construct, a\nhardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man's skills, ob-\nsessions, kneejerk responses.... The local came booming in\nalong the black induction strip, fine grit sifting from cracks in\nthe tunnel's ceiling. Case shuffled into the nearest door and\nwatched the other passengers as he rode. A pair of predatory-\nlooking Christian Scientists were edging toward a trio of young\noffice techs who wore idealized holographic vaginas on their\nwrists, wet pink glittering under the harsh lighting. The techs\nlicked their perfect lips nervously and eyed the Christian Sci-\nentists from beneath lowered metallic lids. The girls looked\nlike tall, exotic grazing animals, swaying gracefully and un-\nconsciously with the movement of the train, their high heels\nlike polished hooves against the gray metal of the car's floor.\nBefore they could stampede, take flight from the missionaries,\nthe train reached Case's station.\nHe stepped out and caught sight of a white holographic cigar\nsuspended against the wall of the station, FREESIDE pulsing\nbeneath it in contorted capitals that mimicked printed Japanese.\nHe walked through the crowd and stood beneath it, studying\nthe thing. WHY WAIT? pulsed the sign. A blunt white spindle,\nflanged and studded with grids and radiators, docks, domes.\nHe'd seen the ad, or others like it, thousands of times. It had\nnever appealed to him. With his deck, he could reach the\nFreeside banks as easily as he could reach Atlanta. Travel was\na meat thing. But now he noticed the little sigil, the size of a\nsmall coin, woven into the lower left corner of the ad's fabric\nof light: T-A.\nHe walked back to the loft, lost in memories of the Flatline.\nHe'd spent most of his nineteenth summer in the Gentleman\nLoser, nursing expensive beers and watching the cowboys.\nHe'd never touched a deck, then, but he knew what he wanted.\nThere were at least twenty other hopefuls ghosting the Loser,\nthat summer, each one bent on working joeboy for some cow-\nboy. No other way to learn.\nThey'd all heard of Pauley, the redneck jockey from the\n'Lanta fringes, who'd survived braindeath behind black ice.\nThe grapevine--slender, street level, and the only one going--\nhad little to say about Pauley, other than that he'd done the\nimpossible. \"It was big,\" another would-be told Case, for the\nprice of a beer, \"but who knows what? I hear maybe a Brazilian\npayroll net. Anyway, the man was dead, flat down braindeath.\"\nCase stared across the crowded bar at a thickset man in shirt-\nsleeves, something leaden about the shade of his skin.\n\"Boy,\" the Flatline would tell him, months later in Miami,\n\"I'm like them huge fuckin' lizards, you know? Had themself\ntwo goddam brains, one in the head an' one by the tailbone,\nkept the hind legs movin'. Hit that black stuff and ol' tailbrain\njus' kept right on keepin' on.\"\nThe cowboy elite in the Loser shunned Pauley out of some\nstrange group anxiety, almost a superstition. McCoy Pauley,\nLazarus of cyberspace....\nAnd his heart had done for him in the end. His surplus\nRussian heart, implanted in a POW camp during the war. He'd\nrefused to replace the thing, saying he needed its particular\nbeat to maintain his sense of timing. Case fingered the slip of\npaper Molly had given him and made his way up the stairs.\nMolly was snoring on the temperfoam. A transparent cast\nran from her knee to a few millimeters below her crotch, the\nskin beneath the rigid micropore mottled with bruises, the black\nshading into ugly yellow. Eight derms, each a different size\nand color, ran in a neat line down her left wrist. An Akai\ntransdermal unit lay beside her, its fine red leads connected to\ninput trodes under the cast.\nHe turned on the tensor beside the Hosaka. The crisp circle\nof light fell directly on the Flatline's construct. He slotted some\nice, connected the construct, and jacked in.\nIt was exactly the sensation of someone reading over his\nshoulder.\nHe coughed. \"Dix? McCoy? That you man?\" His throat was\ntight.\n\"Hey, bro,\" said a directionless voice.\n\"It's Case, man. Remember?\"\n\"Miami, joeboy, quick study.\"\n\"What's the last thing you remember before I spoke to you,\nDix?\"\n\"Nothin'.\"\n\"Hang on.\" He disconnected the construct. The presence\nwas gone. He reconnected it. \"Dix? Who am I?\"\n\"You got me hung, Jack. Who the fuck are you?\"\n\"Ca--your buddy. Partner. What's happening, man?\"\n\"Good question.\"\n\"Remember being here, a second ago?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Know how a ROM personality matrix works?\"\n\"Sure, bro, it's a firmware construct.\"\n\"So I jack it into the bank I'm using, I can give it sequential,\nreal time memory?\"\n\"Guess so,\" said the construct.\n\"Okay, Dix. You are a ROM construct. Got me?\"\n\"If you say so,\" said the construct. \"Who are you?\"\n\"Case.\"\n\"Miami,\" said the voice, \"joeboy, quick study.\"\n\"Right. And for starts, Dix, you and me, we're gonna sleaze\nover to London grid and access a little data. You game for\nthat?\"\n\"You gonna tell me I got a choice, boy?\""], "6": [":27:52 by the chip in her optic nerve; Case had been\nfollowing her progress through Villa Straylight for over an\nhour, letting the endorphin analog she'd taken blot out his\nhangover. The pain in her leg was gone; she seemed to move\nthrough a warm bath. The Braun drone was perched on her\nshoulder, its tiny manipulators, like padded surgical clips, se-\ncure in the polycarbon of the Modern suit.\nThe walls here were raw steel, striped with rough brown\nribbons of epoxy where some kind of covering had been ripped\naway. She'd hidden from a work crew, crouching, the fletcher\ncradled in her hands, her suit steel-gray, while the two slender\nAfricans and their balloon-tired workcart passed. The men had\nshaven heads and wore orange coveralls. One was singing softly\nto himself in a language Case had never heard, the tones and\nmelody alien and haunting.\nThe head's speech, 3Jane's essay on Straylight, came back\nto him as she worked her way deeper into the maze of the\nplace. Straylight was crazy, was craziness grown in the resin\nconcrete they'd mixed from pulverized lunar stone, grown in\nwelded steel and tons of knick-knacks, all the bizarre impe-\ndimentia they'd shipped up the well to line their winding nest.\nBut it wasn't a craziness he understood. Not like Armitage's\nmadness, which he now imagined he could understand; twist\na man far enough, then twist him as far back, in the opposite\ndirection, reverse and twist again. The man broke. Like break-\ning a length of wire. And history had done that for Colonel\nCorto. History had already done the really messy work, when\nWintermute found him, sifting him out of all of the war's ripe\ndetritus, gliding into the man's flat gray field of consciousness\nlike a water spider crossing the face of some stagnant pool,\nthe first messages blinking across the face of a child's micro\nin a darkened room in a French asylum. Wintermute had built\nArmitage up from scratch, with Corto's memories of Screaming\nFist as the foundation. But Armitage's \"memories\" wouldn't\nhave been Corto's after a certain point. Case doubted if Ar-\nmitage had recalled the betrayal, the Nightwings whirling down\nin flame.... Armitage had been a sort of edited version of\nCorto, and when the stress of the run had reached a certain\npoint, the Armitage mechanism had crumbled; Corto had sur-\nfaced, with his guilt and his sick fury. And now Corto-Armitage\nwas dead, a small frozen moon for Freeside.\nHe thought of the toxin sacs. Old Ashpool was dead too,\ndrilled through the eye with Molly's microscopic dart, deprived\nof whatever expert overdose he'd mixed for himself. That was\na more puzzling death, Ashpool's, the death of a mad king.\nAnd he'd killed the puppet he'd called his daughter, the one\nwith 3Jane's face. It seemed to Case, as he rode Molly's broad-\ncast sensory input through the corridors of Straylight, that he'd\nnever really thought of anyone like Ashpool, anyone as pow-\nerful as he imagined Ashpool had been, as human.\nPower, in Case's world, meant corporate power. The zai-\nbatsus, the multinationals that shaped the course of human\nhistory, had transcended old barriers. Viewed as organisms,\nthey had attained a kind of immortality. You couldn't kill a\nzaibatsu by assassinating a dozen key executives; there were\nothers waiting to step up the ladder, assume the vacated po-\nsition, access the vast banks of corporate memory. But Tessier-\nAshpool wasn't like that, and he sensed the difference in the\ndeath of its founder. T-A was an atavism, a clan. He remem-\nbered the litter of the old man's chamber, the soiled humanity\nof it, the ragged spines of the old audio disks in their paper\nsleeves. One foot bare, the other in a velvet slipper.\nThe Braun plucked at the hood of the Modem suit and Molly\nturned left, through another archway.\nWintermute and the nest. Phobic vision of the hatching\nwasps, time-lapse machine gun of biology. But weren't the\nzaibatsus more like that, or the Yakuza, hives with cybernetic\nmemories, vast single organisms, their DNA coded in silicon?\nIf Straylight was an expression of the corporate identity of\nTessier-Ashpool, then T-A was crazy as the old man had been.\nThe same ragged tangle of fears, the same strange sense of\naimlessness. \"If they'd turned into what they wanted to....\"\nhe remembered Molly saying. But Wintermute had told her\nthey hadn't.\nCase had always taken it for granted that the real bosses,\nthe kingpins in a given industry, would be both more and less\nthan people. He'd seen it in the men who'd crippled him in\nMemphis, he'd seen Wage affect the semblance of it in Night\nCity, and it had allowed him to accept Armitage's flatness and\nlack of feeling. He'd always imagined it as a gradual and willing\naccommodation of the machine, the system, the parent or-\nganism. It was the root of street cool, too, the knowing posture\nthat implied connection, invisible lines up to hidden levels of\ninfluence.\nBut what was happening now, in the corridors of Villa\nStraylight?\nWhole stretches were being stripped back to steel and con-\ncrete.\n\"Wonder where our Peter is now, huh? Maybe see that boy\nsoon,\" she muttered. \"And Armitage. Where's he, Case?\"\n\"Dead,\" he said, knowing she couldn't hear him, \"he's\ndead.\"\nHe flipped.", "The Chinese program was face to face with the target ice,\nrainbow tints gradually dominated by the green of the rectangle\nrepresenting the T-A cores. Arches of emerald across the col-\norless void.\n\"How's it go, Dixie?\"\n\"Fine. Too slick. Thing's amazing.... Shoulda had one that\ntime in Singapore. Did the old New Bank of Asia for a good\nfiftieth of what they were worth. But that's ancient history.\nThis baby takes all the drudgery out of it. Makes you wonder\nwhat a real war would be like, now....\"\n\"If this kinda shit was on the street, we'd be out a job,\"\nCase said.\n\"You wish. Wait'll you're steering that thing upstairs through\nblack ice.\"\n\"Sure.\"\nSomething small and decidedly nongeometric had just ap-\npeared on the far end of one of the emerald arches.\n\"Dixie . . .\"\n\"Yeah. I see it. Don't know if I believe it.\"\nA brownish dot, a dull gnat against the green wall of the\nT-A cores. It began to advance, across the bridge built by\nKuang Grade Mark Eleven, and Case saw that it was walking.\nAs it came, the green section of the arch extended, the poly-\nchrome of the virus program rolling back, a few steps ahead\nof the cracked black shoes.\n\"Gotta hand it to you, boss,\" the Flatline said, when the\nshort, rumpled figure of the Finn seemed to stand a few meters\naway. \"I never seen anything this funny when I was alive.\"\nBut the eerie nonlaugh didn't come.\n\"I never tried it before,\" the Finn said, showing his teeth,\nhis hands bunched in the pockets of his frayed jacket.\n\"You killed Armitage,\" Case said.\n\"Corto. Yeah. Armitage was already gone. Hadda do it. I\nknow, I know, you wanna get the enzyme. Okay. No sweat.\nI was the one gave it to Armitage in the first place. I mean I\ntold him what to use. But I think maybe it's better to let the\ndeal stand. You got enough time. I'll give it to you. Only a\ncoupla hours now, right?\"\nCase watched blue smoke billow in cyberspace as the Finn\nlit up one of his Partagas.\n\"You guys,\" the Finn said, \"you're a pain. The Flatline\nhere, if you were all like him, it would be real simple. He's a\nconstruct, just a buncha ROM, so he always does what I expect\nhim to. My projections said there wasn't much chance of Molly\nwandering in on Ashpool's big exit scene, give you one ex-\nample.\" He sighed.\n\"Why'd he kill himself?\" Case asked.\n\"Why's anybody kill himself?\" The figure shrugged. \"I guess\nI know, if anybody does, but it would take me twelve hours\nto explain the various factors in his history and how they in-\nterrelate. He was ready to do it for a long time, but he kept\ngoing back into the freezer. Christ, he was a tedious old fuck.\"\nThe Finn's face wrinkled with disgust. \"It's all tied in with\nwhy he killed his wife, mainly, you want the short reason. But\nwhat sent him over the edge for good and all, little 3Jane figured\na way to fiddle the program that controlled his cryogenic sys-\ntem. Subtle, too. So basically, she killed him. Except he figured\nhe'd killed himself, and your friend the avenging angel figures\nshe got him with an eyeball full of shellfish juice.\" The Finn\nflicked his butt away into the matrix below. \"Well, actually,\nI guess I did give 3Jane the odd hint, a little of the old how-\nto, you know?\"\n\"Wintermute,\" Case said, choosing the words carefully,\n\"you told me you were just a part of something else. Later on\nyou said you wouldn't exist, if the run goes off and Molly gets\nthe word into the right slot.\"\nThe Finn's streamlined skull nodded.\n\"Okay, then who we gonna be dealing with then? If Ar-\nmitage is dead, and you're gonna be gone, just who exactly is\ngoing to tell me how to get these fucking toxin sacs out of my\nsystem? Who's going to get Molly back out of there? I mean\nwhere, where exactly, are all our asses gonna be, we cut you\nloose from the hardwiring?\"\nThe Finn took a wooden toothpick from his pocket and\nregarded it critically, like a surgeon examining a scalpel. \"Good\nquestion,\" he said, finally. \"You know salmon? Kinda fish?\nThese fish, see, they're compelled to swim upstream. Got it?\"\n\"No,\" Case said.\n\"Well, I'm under compulsion myself. And I don't know\nwhy. If I were gonna subject you to my very own thoughts,\nlet's call 'em speculations, on the topic, it would take a couple\nof your lifetimes. Because I've given it a lot of thought. And\nI just don't know. But when this is over, we do it right, I'm\ngonna be part of something bigger. Much bigger,\" The Finn\nglanced up and around the matrix. \"But the parts of me that\nare me now, that'll still be here. And you'll get your\npayoff.\"\nCase fought back an insane urge to punch himself forward\nand get his fingers around the figure's throat, just above the\nragged knot in the rusty scarf. His thumbs deep in the Finn's\nlarynx.\n\"Well, good luck,\" the Finn said. He turned, hands in pock-\nets and began trudging back up the green arch.\n\"Hey, asshole,\" the Flatline said, when the Finn had gone\na dozen paces. The figure paused, half turned. \"What about\nme? What about my payoff?\"\n\"You'll get yours,\" it said.\n\"What's that mean?\" Case asked, as he watched the narrow\ntweed back recede.\n\"I wanna be erased,\" the construct said. \"I told you that,\nremember?\"", "Straylight reminded Case of deserted early morning shop-\nping centers he'd known as a teenager, low-density places\nwhere the small hours brought a fitful stillness, a kind of numb\nexpectancy, a tension that left you watching insects swarm\naround caged bulbs above the entrance of darkened shops.\nFringe places, just past the borders of the Sprawl, too far from\nthe all-night click and shudder of the hot core. There was that\nsame sense of being surrounded by the sleeping inhabitants of\na waking world he had no interest in visiting or knowing, of\ndull business temporarily suspended, of futility and repetition\nsoon to wake again.\nMolly had slowed now, either knowing that she was nearing\nher goal or out of concern for her leg. The pain was starting\nto work its jagged way back through the endorphins, and he\nwasn't sure what that meant. She didn't speak, kept her teeth\nclenched, and carefully regulated her breathing. She'd passed\nmany things that Case hadn't understood, but his curiosity was\ngone. There had been a room filled with shelves of books, a\nmillion flat leaves of yellowing paper pressed between bindings\nof cloth or leather, the shelves marked at intervals by labels\nthat followed a code of letters and numbers; a crowded gallery\nwhere Case had stared, through Molly's incurious eyes, at a\nshattered, dust-stenciled sheet of glass, a thing labeled--her\ngaze had tracked the brass plaque automatically--\"La mariee\nmise a nu par ses celibataires, meme.\" She'd reached out and\ntouched this, her artificial nails clicking against the Lexan sand-\nwich protecting the broken glass. There had been what was\nobviously the entrance to Tessier-Ashpool's cryogenic com-\npound, circular doors of black glass trimmed with chrome.\nShe'd seen no one since the two Africans and their cart,\nand for Case they'd taken on a sort of imaginary life; he pictured\nthem gliding gently through the halls of Straylight, their smooth\ndark skulls gleaming, nodding, while the one still sang his tired\nlittle song. And none of this was anything like the Villa Stray-\nlight he would have expected, some cross between Cath's fairy\ntale castle and a half-remembered childhood fantasy of the\nYakuza's inner sanctum.\n07:02: 1 8 .\nOne and a half hours.\n\"Case,\" she said, \"I wanna favor.\" Stiffly, she lowered\nherself to sit on a stack of polished steel plates, the finish of\neach plate protected by an uneven coating of clear plastic. She\npicked at a rip in the plastic on the topmost plate, blades sliding\nfrom beneath thumb and forefinger. \"Leg's not good, you know?\nDidn't figure any climb like that, and the endorphin won't cut\nit, much longer. So maybe--just maybe, right?--I got a prob-\nlem here. What it is, if I buy it here, before Riviera does\"--\nand she stretched her leg, kneaded the flesh of her thigh through\nModern polycarbon and Paris leather--\"I want you to tell him.\nTell him it was me. Got it? Just say it was Molly. He'll know.\nOkay?\" She glanced around the empty hallway, the bare walls.\nThe floor here was raw lunar concrete and the air smelled of\nresins. \"Shit, man, I don't even know if you're listening.\"\nCASE.\nShe winced, got to her feet, nodded. \"What's he told you,\nman, Wintermute? He tell you about Marie-France? She was\nthe Tessier half, 3Jane's genetic mother. And of that dead\npuppet of Ashpool's, I guess. Can't figure why he'd tell me,\ndown in that cubicle ... lotta stuff.... Why he has to come on\nlike the Finn or somebody, he told me that. It's not just a mask,\nit's like he uses real profiles as valves, gears himself down to\ncommunicate with us. Called it a template. Model of per-\nsonality.\" She drew her fletcher and limped away down the\ncorridor.\nThe bare steel and scabrous epoxy ended abruptly, replaced\nby what Case at first took to be a rough tunnel blasted from\nsolid rock. Molly examined its edge and he saw that in fact\nthe steel was sheathed with panels of something that looked\nand felt like cold stone. She knelt and touched the dark sand\nspread across the floor of the imitation tunnel. It felt like sand,\ncool and dry, but when she drew her finger through it, it closed\nlike a fluid, leaving the surface undisturbed. A dozen meters\nahead, the tunnel curved. Harsh yellow light threw hard shad-\nows on the seamed pseudo-rock of the walls. With a start, Case\nrealized that the gravity here was near earth normal, which\nmeant that she'd had to descend again, after the climb. He was\nthoroughly lost now; spatial disorientation held a peculiar hor-\nror for cowboys.\nBut she wasn't lost, he told himself.\nSomething scurried between her legs and went ticking across\nthe un-sand of the floor. A red LED blinked. The Braun.\nThe first of the holos waited just beyond the curve, a sort\nof triptych. She lowered the fletcher before Case had had time\nto realize that the thing was a recording. The figures were\ncaricatures in light, lifesize cartoons: Molly, Armitage, and\nCase . Molly' s breasts were too large, visible through tight black\nmesh beneath a heavy leather jacket. Her waist was impossibly\nnarrow. Silvered lenses covered half her face. She held an\nabsurdly elaborate weapon of some kind, a pistol shape nearly\nlost beneath a flanged overlay of scope sights, silencers, flash\nhiders. Her legs were spread, pelvis canted forward, her mouth\nfixed in a leer of idiotic cruelty. Beside her, Armitage stood\nrigidly at attention in a threadbare khaki uniform. His eyes,\nCase saw, as Molly stepped carefully forward, were tiny mon-\nitor screens, each one displaying the blue-gray image of a\nhowling waste of snow, the stripped black trunks of evergreens\nbending in silent winds.\nShe passed the tips of her fingers through Armitage's tele-\nvision eyes, then turned to the figure of Case. Here, it was as\nif Riviera--and Case had known instantly that Riviera was\nresponsible--had been unable to find anything worthy of par-\nody. The figure that slouched there was a fair approximation\nof the one he glimpsed daily in mirrors. Thin, high-shouldered,\na forgettable face beneath short dark hair. He needed a shave,\nbut then he usually did.\nMolly stepped back. She looked from one figure to another.\nrt was a static display, the only movement the silent gusting\nof the black trees in Armitage's frozen Siberian eyes.\n\"Tryin' to tell us something, Peter?\" she asked softly. Then\nshe stepped forward and kicked at something between the feet\nof the holo-Molly. Metal clinked against the wall and the figures\nwere gone. She bent and picked up a small display unit. \"Guess\nhe can Jack into these and program them direct,\" she said,\ntossing it away.\nShe passed the source of yellow light, an archaic incandes-\ncent globe set into the wall, protected by a rusty curve of\nexpansion grating. The style of the improvised fixture sug-\ngested childhood, somehow. He remembered fortresses he'd\nbuilt with other children on rooftops and in flooded sub-base-\nments. A rich kid's hideout, he thought. This kind of roughness\nwas expensive. What they called atmosphere.\nShe passed a dozen more holograms before she reached the\nentrance to 3Jane's apartments. One depicted the eyeless thing\nin the alley behind the Spice Bazaar, as it tore itself free of\nRiviera's shattered body. Several others were scenes of torture,\nthe inquisitors always military officers and the victims invari-\nably young women. These had the awful intensity of Riviera's\nshow at the Vingtieme Siecle, as though they had been frozen\nin the blue flash of orgasm. Molly looked away as she passed\nthem.\nThe last was small and dim, as if it were an image Riviera\nhad had to drag across some private distance of memory and\ntime. She had to kneel to examine it; it had been projected\nfrom the vantage point of a small child. None of the others\nhad had backgrounds; the figures, uniforms, instruments of\ntorture, all had been freestanding displays. But this was a view.\nA dark wave of rubble rose against a colorless sky, beyond\nits crest the bleached, half-melted skeletons of city towers. The\nrubble wave was textured like a net, rusting steel rods twisted\ngracefully as fine string, vast slabs of concrete still clinging\nthere. The foreground might once have been a city square;\nthere was a sort of stump, something that suggested a fountain.\nAt its base, the children and the soldier were frozen. The tableau\nwas confusing at first. Molly must have read it correctly before\nCase had quite assimilated it, because he felt her tense. She\nspat, then stood.\nChildren. Feral, in rags. Teeth glittering like knives. Sores\non their contorted faces. The soldier on his back, mouth and\nthroat open to the sky. They were feeding.\n\"Bonn,\" she said, something like gentleness in her voice.\n\"Quite the product, aren't you, Peter? But you had to be. Our\n3Jane, she's too jaded now to open the back door for just any\npetty thief. So Wintermute dug you up. The ultimate taste, if\nyour taste runs that way. Demon lover. Peter.\" She shivered.\n\"But you talked her into letting me in. Thanks. Now we're\ngonna party.\"\nAnd then she was walking--strolling, really, in spite of the\npain--away from Riviera's childhood. She drew the fletcher\nfrom its holster, snapped the plastic magazine out, pocketed\nthat, and replaced it with another. She hooked her thumb in\nthe neck of the Modern suit and ripped it open to the crotch\nwith a single gesture, her thumb blade parting the tough po-\nlycarbon like rotten silk. She freed herself from the arms and\nlegs, the shredded remnants disguising themselves as they fell\nto the dark false sand.\nCase noticed the music then. A music he didn't know, all\nhorns and piano.\nThe entrance to 3Jane's world had no door. It was a ragged\nfive-meter gash in the tunnel wall, uneven stairs leading down\nin a broad shallow curve. Faint blue light, moving shadows,\nmusic.\n\"Case,\" she said, and paused, the fletcher in her right hand.\nThen she raised her left, smiled, touched her open palm with\na wet tongue tip, kissing him through the simstim link. \"Gotta\ngo.\"\nThen there was something small and heavy in her left hand,\nher thumb against a tiny stud, and she was descending."], "7": ["It was raining in Beyoglu, and the rented Mercedes slid past\nthe grilled and unlit windows of cautious Greek and Armenian\njewelers. The street was almost empty, only a few dark-coated\nfigures on the sidewalks turning to stare after the car.\n\"This was formerly the prosperous European section of Ot-\ntoman Istanbul,\" purred the Mercedes.\n\"So it's gone downhill,\" Case said.\n\"The Hilton's in Cumhuriyet Caddesi,\" Molly said. She\nsettled back against the car's gray ultrasuede.\n\"How come Armitage flies alone?\" Case asked. He had a\nheadache.\n\"'Cause you get up his nose. You're sure getting up mine.\"\nHe wanted to tell her the Corto story, but decided against\nit. He'd used a sleep derm, on the plane.\nThe road in from the airport had been dead straight, like a\nneat incision, laying the city open. He'd watched the crazy\nwalls of patchwork wooden tenements slide by, condos, ar-\ncologies, grim housing projects, more walls of plyboard and\ncorrugated iron.\nThe Finn, in a new Shinjuku suit, sarariman black, was\nwaiting sourly in the Hilton lobby, marooned on a velour arm-\nchair in a sea of pale blue carpeting.\n\"Christ,\" Molly said. \"Rat in a business suit.\"\nThey crossed the lobby.\n\"How much you get paid to come over here, Finn?\" She\nlowered her bag beside the armchair. \"Bet not as much as you\nget for wearing that suit, huh?\"\nThe Finn' s upper lips drew back. \"Not enough, sweetmeat. \"\nHe handed her a magnetic key with a round yellow tag. \"You're\nregistered already. Honcho's upstairs.\" He looked around. \"This\ntown sucks.\"\n\"You get agoraphobic, they take you out from under a dome.\nJust pretend it's Brooklyn or something.\" She twirled the key\naround a finger. \"You here as valet or what?\"\n\"I gotta check out some guy's implants,\" the Finn said.\n\"How about my deck?\" Case asked.\nThe Finn winced. \"Observe the protocol. Ask the boss.\"\nMolly's fingers moved in the shadow of her jacket, a flicker\nof jive. The Finn watched, then nodded.\n\"Yeah,\" she said, \"I know who that is.\" She jerked her head\nin the direction of the elevators. \"Come on, cowboy.\" Case\nfollowed her with both bags.", "Their room might have been the one in Chiba where he'd\nfirst seen Armitage. He went to the window, in the morning,\nalmost expecting to see Tokyo Bay. There was another hotel\nacross the street. It was still raining. A few letter-writers had\ntaken refuge in doorways, their old voiceprinters wrapped in\nsheets of clear plastic, evidence that the written word still\nenjoyed a certain prestige here. It was a sluggish country. He\nwatched a dull black Citroen sedan, a primitive hydrogen-cell\nconversion, as it disgorged five sullen-looking Turkish officers\nin rumpled green uniforms. They entered the hotel across the\nstreet.\nHe glanced back at the bed, at Molly, and her paleness\nstruck him. She'd left the micropore cast on the bedslab in\ntheir loft, beside the transdermal inducer. Her glasses reflected\npart of the room's light fixture.\nHe had the phone in his hand before it had a chance to ring\ntwice. \"Glad you're up,\" Armitage said.\n\"I'm just. Lady's still under. Listen, boss, I think it's maybe\ntime we have a little talk. I think I work better if I know a\nlittle more about what I'm doing.\"\nSilence on the line. Case bit his lip.\n\"You know as much as you need to. Maybe more.\"\n\"You think so?\"\n\"Get dressed, Case. Get her up. You'll have a caller in\nabout fifteen minutes. His name is Terzibashjian.\" The phone\nbleated softly. Armitage was gone.\n\"Wake up, baby,\" Case said. \"Biz.\"\n\"I've been awake an hour already.\" The mirrors turned.\n\"We got a Jersey Bastion coming up.\"\n\"You got an ear for language, Case. Bet you're part Ar-\nmenian. That's the eye Armitage has had on Riviera. Help me\nup.\"\nTerzibashjian proved to be a young man in a gray suit and\ngold-framed, mirrored glasses. His white shirt was open at the\ncollar, revealing a mat of dark hair so dense that Case at first\nmistook it for some kind of t-shirt. He arrived with a black\nHilton tray arranged with three tiny, fragrant cups of thick\nblack coffee and three sticky, straw-colored Oriental sweets.\n\"We must, as you say in Ingiliz, take this one very easy.\"\nHe seemed to stare pointedly at Molly, but at last he removed\nthe silver glasses. His eyes were a dark brown that matched\nthe shade of his very short military-cut hair. He smiled. \"It is\nbetter, this way, yes? Else we make the tunel infinity, mirror\ninto mirror.... You particularly,\" he said to her, \"must take\ncare. In Turkey there is disapproval of women who sport such\nmodifications.\"\nMolly bit one of the pastries in half. \"It's my show, Jack,\"\nshe said, her mouth full. She chewed, swallowed, and licked\nher lips. \"I know about you. Stool for the military, right?\" Her\nhand slid lazily into the front of her jacket and came out with\nthe fletcher. Case hadn't known she had it.\n\"Very easy, please,\" Terzibashjian said, his white china\nthimble frozen centimeters from his lips.\nShe extended the gun. \"Maybe you get the explosives, lots\nof them, or maybe you get a cancer. One dart, shitface. You\nwon't feel it for months.\"\n\"Please. You call this in Ingiliz making me very tight....\"\n\"I call it a bad morning. Now tell us about your man and\nget your ass out of here.\" She put the gun away.\n\"He is living in Fener, at Kuchuk Gulhane Djaddesi 14. 1\nhave his tunel route, nightly to the bazaar. He performs most\nrecently at the Yenishehir Palas Oteli, a modem place in the\nstyle turistik, but it has been arranged that the police have\nshown a certain interest in these shows. The Yenishehir man-\nagement has grown nervous.\" He smiled. He smelled of some\nmetallic aftershave.\n\"I want to know about the implants,\" she said, massaging\nher thigh, \"I want to know exactly what he can do.\"\nTerzibashjian nodded. \"Worst is how you say in Ingiliz, the\nsubliminals.\" He made the word four careful syllables.", "\"On our left,\" said the Mercedes, as it steered through a\nmaze of rainy streets, \"is Kapali Carsi, the grand bazaar.\"\nBeside Case, the Finn made an appreciative noise, but he\nwas looking in the wrong direction. The right side of the street\nwas lined with miniature scrapyards. Case saw a gutted loco-\nmotive atop rust-stained, broken lengths of fluted marble.\nHeadless marble statues were stacked like firewood.\n\"Homesick?\" Case asked.\n\"Place sucks,\" the Finn said. His black silk tie was starting\nto resemble a worn carbon ribbon. There were medallions of\nkebab gravy and fried egg on the lapels of the new suit.\n\"Hey, Jersey,\" Case said to the Armenian, who sat behind\nthem, \"where'd this guy get his stuff installed?\"\n\"In Chiba City. He has no left lung. The other is boosted,\nis how you say it? Anyone might buy these implants, but this\none is most talented.\" The Mercedes swerved, avoiding a bal-\nloon-tired dray stacked with hides. \"I have followed him in the\nstreet and seen a dozen cycles fall, near him, in a day. Find\nthe cyclist in a hospital, the story is always the same. A scorpion\npoised beside a brake lever....\"\n\"'What you see is what you get,' yeah,\" the Finn said. \"I\nseen the schematics on the guy's silicon. Very flash. What he\nimagines, you see. I figure he could narrow it to a pulse and\nfry a retina over easy.\"\n\"You have told this to your woman friend?\" Terzibashjian\nleaned forward between the ultrasuede buckets. \"In Turkey,\nwomen are still women. This one. . .\"\nThe Finn snorted. \"She'd have you wearing your balls for\na bow tie if you looked at her cross-eyed.\"\n\"I do not understand this idiom.\"\n\"That's okay,\" Case said. \"Means shut up.\"\nThe Armenian sat back, leaving a metallic edge of after-\nshave. He began to whisper to a Sanyo transceiver in a strange\nsalad of Greek, French, Turkish, isolated fragments of English.\nThe transceiver answered in French. The Mercedes swung\nsmoothly around a corner. \"The spice bazaar, sometimes called\nthe Egyptian bazaar,\" the car said, \"was erected on the site of\nan earlier bazaar erected by Sultan Hatice in 1660. This is the\ncity's central market for spices, software, perfumes, drugs....\"\n\"Drugs,\" Case said, watching the car's wipers cross and\nrecross the bulletproof Lexan. \"What's that you said before,\nJersey, about this Riviera being wired?\"\n\"A mixture of cocaine and meperidine, yes.\" The Armenian\nwent back to the conversation he was having with the Sanyo.\n' Demerol, they used to call that,\" said the Finn. \"He's a\nspeedball artist. Funny class of people you're mixing with,\nCase.\"\n\"Never mind,\" Case said, turning up the collar of his jacket,\n\"we'll get the poor fucker a new pancreas or something.\"", "Once they entered the bazaar, the Finn brightened notice-\nably, as though he were comforted by the crowd density and\nthe sense of enclosure. They walked with the Armenian along\na broad concourse, beneath soot-stained sheets of plastic and\ngreen-painted ironwork out of the age of steam. A thousand\nsuspended ads writhed and flickered.\n\"Hey, Christ,\" the Finn said, taking Case's arm, \"looka\nthat.\" He pointed. \"It's a horse, man. You ever see a horse?\"\nCase glanced at the embalmed animal and shook his head.\nIt was displayed on a sort of pedestal, near the entrance to a\nplace that sold birds and monkeys. The thing's legs had been\nworn black and hairless by decades of passing hands. \"Saw\none in Maryland once,\" the Finn said, \"and that was a good\nthree years after the pandemic. There's Arabs still trying to\ncode 'em up from the DNA, but they always croak.\"\nThe animal's brown glass eyes seemed to follow them as\nthey passed. Terzibashjian led them into a cafe near the core\nof the market, a low-ceilinged room that looked as though it\nhad been in continuous operation for centuries. Skinny boys\nin soiled white coats dodged between the crowded tables, bal-\nancing steel trays with bottles of Turk-Tuborg and tiny glasses\nof tea.\nCase bought a pack of Yeheyuans from a vendor by the\ndoor. The Armenian was muttering to his Sanyo. \"Come,\" he\nsaid, \"he is moving. Each night he rides the tunel to the bazaar,\nto purchase his mixture from Ali. Your woman is close. Come.\"", "The alley was an old place, too old, the walls cut from\nblocks of dark stone. The pavement was uneven and smelled\nof a century's dripping gasoline, absorbed by ancient limestone.\n\"Can't see shit,\" he whispered to the Finn. \"That's okay for\nsweetmeat,\" the Finn said. \"Quiet,\" said Terzibashjian, too\nloudly\nWood grated on stone or concrete. Ten meters down the\nalley, a wedge of yellow light fell across wet cobbles, widened.\nA figure stepped out and the door grated shut again, leaving\nthe narrow place in darkness. Case shivered.\n\"Now,\" Terzibashjian said, and a brilliant beam of white\nlight, directed from the rooftop of the building opposite the\nmarket, pinned the slender figure beside the ancient wooden\ndoor in a perfect circle. Bright eyes darted left, right, and the\nman crumpled. Case thought someone had shot him; he lay\nface down, blond hair pale against the old stone, his limp hands\nwhite and pathetic.\nThe floodlight never wavered.\nThe back of the fallen man's jacket heaved and burst, blood\nsplashing the wall and doorway. A pair of impossibly long,\nrope-tendoned arms flexed grayish-pink in the glare. The thing\nseemed to pull itself up out of the pavement, through the inert,\nbloody ruin that had been Riviera. It was two meters tall, stood\non two legs, and seemed to be headless. Then it swung slowly\nto face them, and Case saw that it had a head, but no neck. It\nwas eyeless, the skin gleaming a wet intestinal pink. The mouth,\nif it was a mouth, was circular, conical, shallow, and lined\nwith a seething growth of hairs or bristles, glittering like black\nchrome. It kicked the rags of clothing and flesh aside and took\na step, the mouth seeming to scan for them as it moved.\nTerzibashjian said something in Greek or Turkish and rushed\nthe thing, his arms spread like a man attempting to dive through\na window. He went through it. Into the muzzle-flash of a pistol\nfrom the dark beyond the circle of light. Fragments of rock\nwhizzed past Case's head; the Finn jerked him down into a\ncrouch.\nThe light from the rooftop vanished, leaving him with mis-\nmatched afterimages of muzzle-flash, monster, and white beam.\nHis ears rang.\nThen the light returned, bobbing now, searching the shad-\nows. Terzibashjian was leaning against a steel door, his face\nvery white in the glare. He held his left wrist and watched\nblood drip from a wound in his left hand. The blond man,\nwhole again, unbloodied, lay at his feet.\nMolly stepped out of the shadows, all in black, with her\nfletcher in her hand.\n\"Use the radio,\" the Armenian said, through gritted teeth.\n\"Call in Mahmut. We must get him out of here. This is not a\ngood place.\"\n\"Little prick nearly made it,\" the Finn said, his knees crack-\ning loudly as he stood up, brushing ineffectually at the legs of\nhis trousers. \"You were watching the horror-show, right? Not\nthe hamburger that got tossed out of sight. Real cute. Well,\nhelp 'em get his ass outa here. I gotta scan all that gear before\nhe wakes up, make sure Armitage is getting his money's worth.\"\nMolly bent and picked something up. A pistol. \"A Nambu,\"\nshe said. \"Nice gun.\"\nTerzibashjian made a whining sound. Case saw that most\nof his middle finger was missing.", "With the city drenched in predawn blue, she told the Mercedes\nto take them to Topkapi . The Finn and an enormous Turk named\nMahmut had taken Riviera, still unconscious, from the alley.\nMinutes later, a dusty Citroen had arrived for the Armenian\nwho seemed on the verge of fainting.\n\"You're an asshole,\" Molly told the man, opening the car\ndoor for him. \"You shoulda hung back. I had him in my sights\nas soon as he stepped out.\" Terzibashjian glared at her. \"So\nwe're through with you anyway.\" She shoved him in and\nslammed the door. \"Run into you again and I'll kill you,\" she\nsaid to the white face behind the tinted window. The Citroen\nground away down the alley and swung clumsily into the street.\nNow the Mercedes whispered through Istanbul as the city\nwoke. They passed the Beyoglu tunel terminal and sped past\nmazes of deserted back streets, run-down apartment houses that\nreminded Case vaguely of Paris.\n\"What is this thing?\" he asked Molly, as the Mercedes\nparked itself on the fringes of the gardens that surround the\nScraglio. He stared dully at the baroque conglomeration of\nstyles that was Topkapi.\n\"It was sort of a private whorehouse for the King,\" she said,\ngetting out stretching. \"Kept a lotta women there. Now it's a\nmuseum. Kinda like Finn's shop, all this stuff just jumbled in\nthere big diamonds, swords, the left hand of John the\nBaptist....\"\n\"Like in a support vat?\"\n\"Nah. Dead. Got it inside this brass hand thing, little hatch\non the side so the Christians could kiss it for luck. Got it off\nthe Christians about a million years ago, and they never dust\nthe goddam thing, 'cause it's an infidel relic.\"\nBlack iron deer rusted in the gardens of the Seraglio. Case\nwalked beside her, watching the toes of her boots crunch unkept\ngrass made stiff by an early frost. They walked beside a path\nof cold octagonal flagstones. Winter was waiting, somewhere\nin the Balkans.\n\"That Terzi, he's grade-A scum,\" she said. \"He's the secret\npolice. Torturer. Real easy to buy out, too, with the kind of\nmoney Armitage was offering.\" In the wet trees around them,\nbirds began to sing.\n\"I did that job for you,\" Case said, \"the one in London. I\ngot something, but I don't know what it means.\" He told her\nthe Corto story.\n\"Well, I knew there wasn't anybody name of Armitage in\nthat Screaming Fist. Looked it up.\" She stroked the rusted\nflank of an iron doe. \"You figure the little computer pulled\nhim out of it? In that French hospital?\"\n\"I figure Wintermute,\" Case said.\nShe nodded.\n\"Thing is,\" he said, \"do you think he knows he was Corto,\nbefore? I mean, he wasn't anybody in particular, by the time\nhe hit the ward, so maybe Wintermute just. . .\"\n\"Yeah. Built him up from go. Yeah...\" She turned and\nthey walked on. \"It figures. You know, the guy doesn't have\nany life going, in private. Not as far as I can tell. You see a\nguy like that, you figure there's something he does when he's\nalone. But not Armitage. Sits and stares at the wall, man. Then\nsomething clicks and he goes into high gear and wheels for\nWintermute.\"\n\"So why's he got that stash in London? Nostalgia?\"\n\"Maybe he doesn't know about it,\" she said. \"Maybe it's\njust in his name, right?\"\n\"I don't get it,\" Case said.\n\"Just thinking out loud.... How smart's an Al, Case?\"\n\"Depends. Some aren't much smarter than dogs. Pets. Cost\na fortune anyway. The real smart ones are as smart as the\nTuring heat is willing to let 'em get.\"\n\"Look, you're a cowboy. How come you aren't just flat-\nout fascinated with those things?\"\n\"Well,\" he said, \"for starts, they're rare. Most of them are\nmilitary, the bright ones, and we can't crack the ice. That's\nwhere ice all comes from, you know? And then there's the\nTuring cops, and that's bad heat.\" He looked at her. \"I dunno,\nit just isn't part of the trip.\"\n\"Jockeys all the same,\" she said. \"No imagination.\"\nThey came to a broad rectangular pond where carp nuzzled\nthe stems of some white aquatic flower. She kicked a loose\npebble in and watched the ripples spread.\n\"That's Wintermute,\" she said. \"This deal's real big, looks\nto me. We're out where the little waves are too broad, we can't\nsee the rock that hit the center. We know something's there,\nbut not why. I wanna know why. I want you to go and talk to\nWintermute.\"\n\"I couldn't get near it,\" he said. \"You're dreaming.\"\n\"Try.\"\n\"Can't be done.\"\n\"Ask the Flatline.\"\n\"What do we want out of that Riviera?\" he asked, hoping\nto change the subject.\nShe spat into the pond. \"God knows. I'd as soon kill him\nas look at him. I saw his profile. He's a kind of compulsive\nJudas. Can't get off sexually unless he knows he's betraying\nthe object of desire. That's what the file says. And they have\nto love him first. Maybe he loves them, too. That's why it was\neasy for Terzi to set him up for us, because he's been here\nthree years, shopping politicals to the secret police. Probably\nTerzi let him watch, when the cattle prods came out. He's done\neighteen in three years. All women age twenty to twenty-five.\nIt kept Terzi in dissidents.\" She thrust her hands into her jacket\npockets. \"Because if he found one he really wanted, he'd make\nsure she turned political. He's got a personality like a Modern's\nsuit. The profile said it was a very rare type, estimated one in\na couple of million. Which anyway says something good about\nhuman nature, I guess.\" She stared at the white flowers and\nthe sluggish fish, her face sour. \"I think I'm going to have to\nbuy myself some special insurance on that Peter.\" Then she\nturned and smiled, and it was very cold.\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"Never mind. Let's go back to Beyoglu and find something\nlike breakfast. I gotta busy night again, tonight. Gotta collect\nhis stuff from that apartment in Fener, gotta go back to the\nbazaar and buy him some drugs....\"\n\"Buy him some drugs? How's he rate?\"\nShe laughed. \"He's not dying on the wire, sweetheart. And\nit looks like he can't work without that special taste. I like you\nbetter now, anyway, you aren't so goddam skinny.\" She smiled.\n\"So I'll go to Ali the dealer and stock up. You betcha.\"", "Armitage was waiting in their room at the Hilton.\n\"Time to pack,\" he said, and Case tried to find the man\ncalled Corto behind the pale blue eyes and the tanned mask.\nHe thought of Wage, back in Chiba. Operators above a certain\nlevel tended to submerge their personalities, he knew. But\nWage had had vices, lovers. Even, it had been rumored, chil-\ndren. The blankness he found in Armitage was something else.\n\"Where to now?\" he asked, walking past the man to stare\ndown into the street. \"What kind of climate?\"\n\"They don't have climate, just weather,\" Armitage said.\n\"Here. Read the brochure.\" He put something on the coffee\ntable and stood.\n\"Did Riviera check out okay? Where's the Finn?\"\n\"Riviera's fine. The Finn is on his way home.\" Armitage\nsmiled, a smile that meant as much as the twitch of some\ninsect's antenna. His gold bracelet clinked as he reached out\nto prod Case in the chest. \"Don't get too smart. Those little\nsacs are starting to show wear, but you don't know how much.\"\nCase kept his face very still and forced himself to nod.\nWhen Armitage was gone, he picked up one of the bro-\nchures. It was expensively printed, in French, English, and\nTurkish.\nFREESIDE--WHY WAIT?", "The four of them were booked on a THY flight out of Yes-\nilkoy airport. Transfer at Paris to the JAL shuttle. Case sat in\nthe lobby of the Istanbul Hilton and watched Riviera browse\nbogus Byzantine fragments in the glass-walled gift-shop. Ar-\nmitage, his trenchcoat draped over his shoulders like a cape,\nstood in the shop's entrance.\nRiviera was slender, blond, soft-voiced, his English ac-\ncentless and fluid. Molly said he was thirty, but it would have\nbeen difficult to guess his age. She also said he was legally\nstateless and traveled under a forged Dutch passport. He was\na product of the rubble rings that fringe the radioactive core\nof old Bonn.\nThree smiling Japanese tourists bustled into the shop, nod-\nding politely to Armitage. Armitage crossed the floor of the\nshop too quickly, too obviously, to stand beside Riviera. Ri-\nviera turned and smiled. He was very beautiful; Case assumed\nthe features were the work of a Chiba surgeon. A subtle job,\nnothing like Armitage's blandly handsome blend of pop faces.\nThe man's forehead was high and smooth, gray eyes calm and\ndistant. His nose, which might have been too nicely sculpted,\nseemed to have been broken and clumsily reset. The suggestion\nof brutality offset the delicacy of his jaw and the quickness of\nhis smile. His teeth were small, even, and very white. Case\nwatched the white hands play over the imitation fragments of\nsculpture.\nRiviera didn't act like a man who'd been attacked the night\nbefore, drugged with a toxin-flechette, abducted, subjected to\nthe Finn's examination, and pressured by Armitage into joining\ntheir team.\nCase checked his watch. Molly was due back from her drug\nrun. He looked up at Riviera again. \"I bet you're stoned right\nnow, asshole,\" he said to the Hilton lobby. A graying Italian\nmatron in a white leather tuxedo jacket lowered her Porsche\nglasses to stare at him. He smiled broadly, stood, and shoul-\ndered his bag. He needed cigarettes for the flight. He wondered\nif there was a smoking section on the JAL shuttle. \"See ya\nlady,\" he said to the woman, who promptly slid the sunglasses\nback up her nose and turned away.\nThere were cigarettes in the gift shop, but he didn't relish\ntalking with Armitage or Riviera. He left the lobby and located\na vending console in a narrow alcove, at the end of a rank of\npay phones.\nHe fumbled through a pocketful of lirasi, slotting the small\ndull alloy coins one after another, vaguely amused by the anach-\nronism of the process. The phone nearest him rang.\nAutomatically, he picked it up.\n\"Yeah?\"\nFaint harmonics, tiny inaudible voices rattling across some\norbital link, and then a sound like wind.\n\"Hello. Case.\"\nA fifty-lirasi coin fell from his hand, bounced, and rolled\nout of sight across Hilton carpeting.\n\"Wintermute, Case. It's time we talk.\"\nIt was a chip voice.\n\"Don't you want to talk, Case?\"\nHe hung up.\nOn his way back to the lobby, his cigarettes forgotten, he\nhad to walk the length of the ranked phones. Each rang in turn,\nbut only once, as he passed.", "PART THREE. MIDNIGHT IN THE RUE JULES VERNE"], "8": ["Archipelago.\nThe islands. Torus, spindle, cluster.

Once, as the plane banked over water,\nCase saw the jewel-glow of a Greek island town. And once,\nreaching for his drink, he caught the flicker of a thing like a\ngiant human sperm in the depths of his bourbon and water.\nMolly leaned across him and slapped Riviera's face, once.\n\"No, baby. No games. You play that subliminal shit around\nme, I'll hurt you real bad. I can do it without damaging you\nat all. I like that.\"\nCase turned automatically to check Armitage's reaction. The\nsmooth face was calm, the blue eyes alert, but there was no\nanger. \"That's right, Peter. Don't.\"\nCase turned back, in time to catch the briefest flash of a\nblack rose, its petals sheened like leather, the black stem thorned\nwith bright chrome.\nPeter Riviera smiled sweetly, closed his eyes, and fell in-\nstantly asleep.\nMolly turned away, her lenses reflected in the dark window.", "\"You been up, haven't you?\" Molly asked, as he squirmed\nhis way back into the deep temperfoam couch on the JAL\nshuttle.\n\"Nah. Never travel much, just for biz.\" The steward was\nattaching readout trodes to his wrist and left ear.\n\"Hope you don't get SAS,\" she said.\n\"Airsick? No way.\"\n\"It's not the same. Your heartbeat'll speed up in zero-g, and\nyour inner ear'll go nuts for a while. Kicks in your flight reflex,\nlike you'll be getting signals to run like hell, and a lot of\nadrenaline.\" The steward moved on to Riviera, taking a new\nset of trodes from his red plastic apron.\nCase turned his head and tried to make out the outline of\nthe old Orly terminals, but the shuttle pad was screened by\ngraceful blast-deflectors of wet concrete. The one nearest the\nwindow bore an Arabic slogan in red spraybomb.\nHe closed his eyes and told himself the shuttle was only a\nbig airplane, one that flew very high. It smelled like an airplane,\nlike new clothes and chewing gum and exhaustion. He listened\nto the piped koto music and waited.\nTwenty minutes, then gravity came down on him like a\ngreat soft hand with bones of ancient stone.", "Space adaptation syndrome was worse than Molly's de-\nscription, but it passed quickly enough and he was able to\nsleep. The steward woke him as they were preparing to dock\nat JAL's terminal cluster.\nWe transfer to Freeside now?\" he asked, eyeing a shred\nof Yeheyuan tobacco that had drifted gracefully up out of his\nshirt pocket to dance ten centimeters from his nose. There was\nno smoking on shuttle flights.\n\"No, we got the boss's usual little kink in the plans, you\nknow? We're getting this taxi out to Zion, Zion cluster.\" She\ntouched the release plate on her harness and began to free\nherself from the embrace of the foam. \"Funny choice of venue,\nyou ask me.\"\n\"How's that?\"\n\"Dreads. Rastas. Colony's about thirty years old now.\"\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\"You'll see. It's an okay place by me. Anyway, they'll let\nyou smoke your cigarettes there.\"", "Zion had been founded by five workers who'd refused to\nreturn, who'd turned their backs on the well and started build-\ning. They'd suffered calcium loss and heart shrinkage before\nrotational gravity was established in the colony's central torus.\nSeen from the bubble of the taxi, Zion's makeshift hull re-\nminded Case of the patchwork tenements of Istanbul, the ir-\nregular, discolored plates laser-scrawled with Rastafarian\nsymbols and the initials of welders.\nMolly and a skinny Zionite called Aerol helped Case ne-\ngotiate a freefall corridor into the core of a smaller torus. He'd\nlost track of Armitage and Riviera in the wake of a second\nwave of SAS vertigo. \"Here,\" Molly said, shoving his legs\ninto a narrow hatchway overhead. \"Grab the rungs. Make like\nyou're climbing backward, right? You're going toward the hull,\nthat's like you're climbing down into gravity. Got it?\"\nCase's stomach churned.\n\"You be fine, mon,\" Aerol said, his grin bracketed with\ngold incisors.\nSomehow, the end of the tunnel had become its bottom.\nCase embraced the weak gravity like a drowning man finding\na pocket of air.\n\"Up,\" Molly said, \"you gonna kiss it next?\" Case lay flat\non the deck, on his stomach, arms spread. Something struck\nhim on the shoulder. He rolled over and saw a fat bundle of\nelastic cable. \"Gotta play house,\" she said. \"You help me string\nthis up.\" He looked around the wide, featureless space and\nnoticed steel rings welded on every surface, seemingly at ran-\ndom.\nWhen they'd strung the cables, according to some complex\nscheme of Molly's, they hung them with battered sheets of\nyellow plastic. As they worked, Case gradually became aware\nof the music that pulsed constantly through the cluster. It was\ncalled dub, a sensuous mosaic cooked from vast libraries of\ndigitalized pop; it was worship, Molly said, and a sense of\ncommunity. Case heaved at one of the yellow sheets; the thing\nwas light but still awkward. Zion smelled of cooked vegetables,\nhumanity, and ganja.\n\"Good,\" Armitage said, gliding loose-kneed through the\nhatch and nodding at the maze of sheets. Riviera followed, less\ncertain in the partial gravity.\n\"Where were you when it needed doing?\" Case asked Ri-\nviera.\nThe man opened his mouth to speak. A small trout swam\nout, trailing impossible bubbles. It glided past Case's cheek.\n\"In the head,\" Riviera said, and smiled.\nCase laughed.\n\"Good,\" Riviera said, \"you can laugh. I would have tried\nto help you, but I'm no good with my hands.\" He held up his\npalms, which suddenly doubled. Four arms, four hands.\n\"Just the harmless clown, right, Riviera?\" Molly stepped\nbetween them.\n\"Yo,\" Aerol said, from the hatch, \"you wan' come wi' me,\ncowboy mon.\"\n\"It's your deck,\" Armitage said, \"and the other gear. Help\nhim get it in from the cargo bay.\"\n\"You ver' pale, mon,\" Aerol said, as they were guiding the\nfoam-bundled Hosaka terminal along the central corridor.\n\"Maybe you wan' eat somethin'.\"\nCase's mouth flooded with saliva; he shook his head.", "Armitage announced an eighty-hour stay in Zion. Molly and\nCase would practice in zero gravity, he said, and acclimatize\nthemselves to working in it. He would brief them on Freeside\nand the Villa Straylight. It was unclear what Riviera was sup-\nposed to be doing, but Case didn't feel like asking. A few\nhours after their arrival, Armitage had sent him into the yellow\nmaze to call Riviera out for a meal. He'd found him curled\nlike a cat on a thin pad of temperfoam, naked, apparently\nasleep, his head orbited by a revolving halo of small white\ngeometric forms, cubes, spheres, and pyramids. \"Hey, Ri-\nviera.\" The ring continued to revolve. He'd gone back and told\nArmitage. \"He's stoned,\" Molly said, looking up from the\ndisassembled parts of her fletcher. \"Leave him be.\"\nArmitage seemed to think that zero-g would affect Case's\nability to operate in the matrix. 'Don't sweat it,\" Case argued,\n\"I jack in and I'm not here. It's all the same.\"\n\"Your adrenaline levels are higher,\" Armitage said. \"You've\nstill got SAS. You won't have time for it to wear off. You're\ngoing to learn to work with it. '\n\"So I do the run from here'?\"\n\"No. Practice, Case. Now. Up in the corridor....\"", "Cyberspace, as the deck presented it, had no particular re-\nlationship with the deck's physical whereabouts. When Case\njacked in, he opened his eyes to the familiar configuration of\nthe Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority's Aztec pyramid of\ndata.\n\"How you doing, Dixie?''\n\"I'm dead, Case. Got enough time in on this Hosaka to\nfigure that one.\"\n\"How's it feel?\"\n\"It doesn't.\"\n\"Bother you?\"\n\"What bothers me is, nothin' does.\"\n\"How's that?\"\n\"Had me this buddy in the Russian camp, Siberia, his thumb\nwas frostbit. Medics came by and they cut it off. Month later\nhe's tossin' all night. Elroy. l said, what's eatin' you? Goddam\nthumb's itchin', he says. So l told him, scratch it. McCoy, he\nsays, it's the other goddam thumb.\" When the construct laughed,\nit came through as something else, not laughter, but a stab of\ncold down Case's spine. \"Do me a favor, boy.\"\n\"What's that, Dix?\"\n\"This scam of yours, when it's over, you erase this goddam\nthing.\"", "Case didn't understand the Zionites.\nAerol, with no particular provocation, related the tale of the\nbaby who had burst from his forehead and scampered into a\nforest of hydroponic ganja. \"Ver' small baby, mon, no long'\nyou finga.\" He rubbed his palm across an unscarred expanse\nof brown forehead and smiled.\n\"It's the ganja,\" Molly said, when Case told her the story.\n\"They don't make much of a difference between states, you\nknow? Aerol tells you it happened, well, it happened to him.\nIt's not like bullshit, more like poetry. Get it?\"\nCase nodded dubiously. The Zionites always touched you\nwhen they were talking, hands on your shoulder. He didn't\nlike that.\n\"Hey, Aerol,\" Case called, an hour later, as he prepared\nfor a practice run in the freefall corridor. \"Come here, man.\nWanna show you this thing.\" He held out the trodes.\nAerol executed a slow-motion tumble. His bare feet struck\nthe steel wall and he caught a girder with his free hand. The\nother held a transparent waterbag bulging with blue-green al-\ngae. He blinked mildly and grinned.\n\"Try it,\" Case said.\nHe took the band, put it on, and Case adjusted the trodes.\nHe closed his eyes. Case hit the power stud. Aerol shuddered.\nCase jacked him back out. \"What did you see, man?\"\n\"Babylon,\" Aerol said, sadly, handing him the trodes and\nkicking off down the corridor.", "Riviera sat motionless on his foam pad, his right arm ex-\ntended straight out, level with his shoulder. A jewel-scaled\nsnake, its eyes like ruby neon, was coiled tightly a few\nmillimeters behind his elbow. Case watched the snake, which\nwas finger-thick and banded black and scarlet, slowly contract,\ntightening around Riviera's arm.\n\"Come then,\" the man said caressingly to the pale waxy\nscorpion poised in the center of his upturned palm. \"Come.\"\nThe scorpion swayed its brownish claws and scurried up his\narm, its feet tracking the faint dark telltales of veins. When it\nreached the inner elbow, it halted and seemed to vibrate. Ri-\nviera made a soft hissing sound. The sting came up, quivered,\nand sank into the skin above a bulging vein. The coral snake\nrelaxed, and Riviera sighed slowly as the injection hit him.\nThen the snake and the scorpion were gone, and he held a\nmilky plastic syringe in his left hand. \"'If God made anything\nbetter, he kept it for himself. ' You know the expression, Case?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Case said. \"I heard that about lots of different\nthings. You always make it into a little show?\"\nRiviera loosened and removed the elastic length of surgical\ntubing from his arm. \"Yes. It's more fun.\" He smiled, his eyes\ndistant now, cheeks flushed. \"I've a membrane set in, just over\nthe vein, so I never have to worry about the condition of the\nneedle.\"\n\"Doesn't hurt?\"\nThe bright eyes met his. \"Of course it does. That's part of\nit, isn't it?\"\n\"I'd just use derms,\" Case said.\n\"Pedestrian,\" Riviera sneered, and laughed, putting on a\nshort-sleeved white cotton shirt.\n\"Must be nice,\" Case said, getting up.\n\"Get high yourself, Case?\"\n\"I hadda give it up.\"", "\"Freeside,\" Armitage said, touching the panel on the little\nBraun hologram projector. The image shivered into focus, nearly\nthree meters from tip to tip. \"Casinos here.\" He reached into\nthe skeletal representation and pointed. \"Hotels, strata-title\nproperty, big shops along here.\" His hand moved. \"Blue areas\nare lakes.\" He walked to one end of the model. \"Big cigar.\nNarrows at the ends.\"\n\"We can see that fine,\" Molly said.\n\"Mountain effect, as it narrows. Ground seems to get higher,\nmore rocky, but it's an easy climb. Higher you climb, the\nlower the gravity. Sports up there. There's velodrome ring\nhere.\" He pointed.\n\"A what?\" Case leaned forward.\n\"They race bicycles,\" Molly said. \"Low grav, high-traction\ntires, get up over a hundred kilos an hour.\"\n\"This end doesn't concern us,\" Armitage said with his usual\nutter seriousness.\n\"Shit,\" Molly said, \"I'm an avid cyclist.\"\nRiviera giggled.\nArmitage walked to the opposite end of the projection. \"This\nend does.\" The interior detail of the hologram ended here, and\nthe final segment of the spindle was empty. \"This is the Villa\nStraylight. Steep climb out of gravity and every approach is\nkinked. There's a single entrance, here, dead center. Zero grav-\nity.\"\n\"What's inside, boss?\" Riviera leaned forward, craning his\nneck. Four tiny figures glittered, near the tip of Armitage's\nfinger. Armitage slapped at them as if they were gnats.\n\"Peter,\" Armitage said, \"you're going to be the first to find\nout. You'll arrange yourself an invitation. Once you're in, you\nsee that Molly gets in.\"\nCase stared at the blankness that represented Straylight,\nremembering the Finn's story: Smith, Jimmy, the talking head,\nand the ninja.\n\"Details available?\" Riviera asked. \"I need to plan a ward-\nrobe, you see.\"\n\"Learn the streets,\" Armitage said, returning to the center\nof the model. \"Desiderata Street here. This is the Rue Jules\nVerne.\"\nRiviera rolled his eyes.\nWhile Armitage recited the names of Freeside avenues, a\ndozen bright pustules rose on his nose, cheeks, and chin. Even\nMolly laughed.\nArmitage paused, regarded them all with his cold empty\neyes.\n\"Sorry,\" Riviera said, and the sores flickered and vanished.", "Case woke, late into the sleeping period, and became aware\nof Molly crouched beside him on the foam. He could feel her\ntension. He lay there confused. When she moved, the sheer\nspeed of it stunned him. She was up and through the sheet of\nyellow plastic before he'd had time to realize she'd slashed it\nopen.\n\"Don't you move, friend.\"\nCase rolled over and put his head through the rent in the\nplastic. \"Wha. . . ?\"\n\"Shut up.\"\n\"You th' one, mon,\" said a Zion voice. \"Cateye, call 'em\ncall 'em Steppin' Razor.

Come.\"", "The two surviving Founders of Zion were old men, old with\nthe accelerated aging that overtakes men who spend too many\nyears outside the embrace of gravity. Their brown legs, brittle\nwith calcium loss, looked fragile in the harsh glare of reflected\nsunlight. They floated in the center of a painted jungle of\nrainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely cov-\nered the hull of the spherical chamber. The air was thick with\nresinous smoke.\n\"Steppin' Razor,\" one said, as Molly drifted into the cham-\nber. \"Like unto a whippin' stick.\"\n\"That is a story we have, sister,\" said the other, \"a religion\nstory. We are glad you've come with Maelcum.\"\n\"How come you don't talk the patois?\" Molly asked.\n\"I came from Los Angeles,\" the old man said. His dread-\nlocks were like a matted tree with branches the color of steel\nwool. \"Long time ago, up the gravity well and out of Babylon.\nTo lead the Tribes home. Now my brother likens you to Step-\npin' Razor.\"\nMolly extended her right hand and the blades flashed in the\nsmoky air.\nThe other Founder laughed, his head thrown back. \"Soon\ncome, the Final Days.... Voices. Voices cryin' inna wilder-\nness, prophesyin' ruin unto Babylon....\"\n\"Voices.\" The Founder from Los Angeles was staring at\nCase. \"We monitor many frequencies. We listen always. Came\na voice, out of the babel of tongues, speaking to us. It played\nus a mighty dub.\"\n\"Call 'em Winter Mute,\" said the other, making it two\nwords.\nCase felt the skin crawl on his arms.\n\"The Mute talked to us,\" the first Founder said. \"The Mute\nsaid we are to help you.\"\n\"When was this?\" Case asked.\n\"Thirty hours prior you dockin' Zion.\"\n\"You ever hear this voice before?\"\n\"No,\" said the man from Los Angeles, \"and we are uncertain\nof its meaning. If these are Final Days, we must expect false\nprophets ....\"\n\"Listen,\" Case said, \"that's an Al, you know? Artificial\nintelligence. The music it played you, it probably just tapped\nyour banks and cooked up whatever it thought you'd like\nto--\"\n\"Babylon,\" broke in the other Founder, \"mothers many de-\nmon, I an' I know. Multitude horde!\"\n\"What was that you called me, old man?\" Molly asked.\n\"Steppin' Razor. An' you bring a scourge on Babylon, sis-\nter, on its darkest heart....\"\n\"What kinda message the voice have?\" Case asked.\n\"We were told to help you,\" the other said, \"that you might\nserve as a tool of Final Days.\" His lined face was troubled.\n\"We were told to send Maelcum with you, in his tug Garvey,\nto the Babylon port of Freeside. And this we shall do.\"\n\"Maelcum a rude boy,\" said the other, \"an' a righteous tug\npilot.\"\n\"But we have decided to send Aerol as well, in Babylon\nRocker, to watch over Garvey.\"\nAn awkward silence filled the dome.\n\"That's it?\" Case asked. \"You guys work for Armitage or\nwhat?\"\n\"We rent you space,\" said the Los Angeles Founder. \"We\nhave a certain involvement here with various traffics, and no\nregard for Babylon's law. Our law is the word of Jah. But this\ntime, it may be, we have been mistaken.\"\n\"Measure twice, cut once,\" said the other, softly.\n\"Come on, Case,\" Molly said. \"Let's get back before the\nman figures out we're gone.\"\n\"Maelcum will take you. Jah love, sister.\"\nThe tug Marcus Garvey, a steel drum nine meters long and\ntwo in diameter, creaked and shuddered as Maelcum punched\nfor a navigational burn. Splayed in his elastic g-web, Case\nwatched the Zionite's muscular back through a haze of sco-\npolamine. He'd taken the drug to blunt SAS, nausea, but the\nstimulants the manufacturer included to counter the scop had\nno effect on his doctored system.\n\"How long's it gonna take us to make Freeside?\" Molly\nasked from her web beside Maelcum's pilot module.\n\"Don' be long now, m'seh dat.\"\n\"You guys ever think in hours?\"\n\"Sister, time, it be time, ya know wha mean?

Like all that time\nyou spent in Zion, plugged in with your lips moving?\"\n\"Pal,\" Case said, \"sure. No. I haven't. But I got a funny\nstory along those lines, left over from Istanbul.\" He told her\nabout the phones in the Hilton.\n\"Christ,\" she said, \"there goes a chance.

Anyway, talk to the Flatline about it.\"\n\"I'm all doped,\" he protested, but reached for the trodes.\nHis deck and the Hosaka had been mounted behind Maelcum's\nmodule along with a very high-resolution Cray monitor.\nHe adjusted the trodes. Marcus Garvey had been thrown\ntogether around an enormous old Russian air scrubber, a rec-\ntangular thing daubed with Rastafarian symbols, Lioos of Zion\nand Black Star Liners, the reds and greens and yellows over-\nlaying wordy decals in Cyrillic script. Someone had sprayed\nMaelcum's pilot gear a hot tropical pink, scraping most of the\noverspray off the screens and readouts with a razor blade. The\ngaskets around the airlock in the bow were festooned with\nsemirigid globs and streamers of translucent caulk, like clumsy\nstrands of imitation seaweed. He glanced past Maelcum's\nshoulder to the central screen and saw a docking display: the\ntug's path was a line of red dots, Freeside a segmented green\ncircle. He watched the line extend itself, generating a new dot.\nHe jacked in.\n\"Dixie?\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"You ever try to crack an AI?\"\n\"Sure. I flatlined. First time. I was larkin' jacked up real\nhigh, out by Rio heavy commerce sector. Big biz, multina-\ntionals, Government of Brazil lit up like a Christmas tree. Just\nlarkin' around, you know?

Jacked up there\nand made a pass.\"\n\"What did it look like, the visual?\"\n\"White cube.\"\n\"How'd you know it was an Al?\"\n\"How'd I know? Jesus. It was the densest ice I'd ever seen.\nSo what else was it? The military down there don't have any-\nthing like that. Anyway, I jacked out and told my computer to\nlook it up.\"\n\"Yeah?\"\n\"It was on the Turing Registry. Al. Frog company owned\nits Rio mainframe.\"\nCase chewed his lower lip and gazed out across the plateaus\nof the Eastern Seaboard Fission Authority, into the infinite\nneuroelectronic void of the matrix. \"Tessier-Ashpool, Dixie?\"\n\"Tessier, yeah.\"\n\"And you went back?\"\n\"Sure. I was crazy. Figured I'd try to cut it. Hit the first\nstrata and that's all she wrote. My joeboy smelled the skin\nfrying and pulled the trodes off me. Mean shit, that ice.\"\n\"And your EEG was flat.\"\n\"Well, that's the stuff of legend, ain't it?\"\nCase jacked out. \"Shit,\" he said, \"how do you think Dixie\ngot himself flatlined, huh? Trying to buzz an AI. Great....\"\n\"Go on,\" she said, \"the two of you are supposed to be\ndynamite, right?\"", "\"Dix,\" Case said, \"I wanna have a look at an AI in Berne.\nCan you think of any reason not to?\"\n\"Not unless you got a morbid fear of death, no.\"\nCase punched for the Swiss banking sector, feeling a wave\nof exhilaration as cyberspace shivered, blurred, gelled. The\nEastern Seaboard Fission Authority was gone, replaced by the\ncool geometric intricacy of Zurich commercial banking. He\npunched again, for Berne.\n\"Up,\" the construct said. \"It'll be high.\"\nThey ascended lattices of light, levels strobing, a blue flicker.\nThat'll be it, Case thought.\nWintermute was a simple cube of white light, that very\nsimplicity suggesting extreme complexity.\n\"Don't look much, does it?\" the Flatline said. \"But just you\ntry and touch it.\"\n\"I'm going in for a pass, Dixie.\"\n\"Be my guest.\"\nCase punched to within four grid points of the cube. Its\nblank face, towering above him now, began to seethe with faint\ninternal shadows, as though a thousand dancers whirled behind\na vast sheet of frosted glass.\n\"Knows we're here,\" the Flatline observed.\nCase punched again, once; they jumped forward by a single\ngrid point.\nA stippled gray circle formed on the face of the cube.\n\"Dixie....\"\n\"Back off, fast.\"\nThe gray area bulged smoothly, became a sphere, and de-\ntached itself from the cube.\nCase felt the edge of the deck sting his palm as he slapped\nMAX REVERSE. The matrix blurred backward; they plunged\ndown a twilit shaft of Swiss banks. He looked up. The sphere\nwas darker now, gaining on him. Falling.\n\"Jack out,\" the Flatline said.\nThe dark came down like a hammer.", "Cold steel odor and ice caressed his spine.\nAnd faces peering in from a neon forest, sailors and hustlers\nand whores, under a poisoned silver sky....\n\"Look, Case, you tell me what the fuck is going on with\nyou, you wig or something?\"\nA steady pulse of pain, midway down his spine--", "Rain woke him, a slow drizzle, his feet tangled in coils of\ndiscarded fiberoptics. The arcade's sea of sound washed over\nhim, receded, returned. Rolling over, he sat up and held his\nhead.\nLight from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed\nhim broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis\nof a gutted game console. Streamlined Japanese was stenciled\nacross the side of the console in faded pinks and yellows.\nHe glanced up and saw a sooty plastic window, a faint glow\nof fluorescents.\nHis back hurt, his spine.\nHe got to his feet, brushed wet hair out of his eyes.\nSomething had happened....\nHe searched his pockets for money, found nothing, and\nshivered. Where was his jacket? He tried to find it, looked\nbehind the console, but gave up.\nOn Ninsei, he took the measure of the crowd. Friday. It\nhad to be a Friday. Linda was probably in the arcade. Might\nhave money, or at least cigarettes.... Coughing, wringing rain\nfrom the front of his shirt, he edged through the crowd to the\narcade's entrance.\nHolograms twisted and shuddered to the roaring of the games,\nghosts overlapping in the crowded haze of the place, a smell\nof sweat and bored tension. A sailor in a white t-shirt nuked\nBonn on a Tank War console, an azure flash.\nShe was playing Wizard's Castle, lost in it, her gray eyes\nrimmed with smudged black paintstick.\nShe looked up as he put his arm around her, smiled. \"Hey.\nHow you doin'? Look wet.\"\nHe kissed her.\n\"You made me blow my game,\" she said. \"Look there\nass hole. Seventh level dungeon and the god dam vampires got\nme.\" She passed him a cigarette. \"You look pretty strung, man.\nWhere you been?\"\n\"I don't know.\"\n\"You high, Case? Drinkin' again? Eatin' Zone's dex?\"\n\"Maybe . . . how long since you seen me?\"\n\"Hey, it's a put-on, right?\" She peered at him. \"Right?\"\n\"No. Some kind of blackout. I . . . I woke up in the alley.\"\n\"Maybe somebody decked you, baby. Got your roll intact?\"\nHe shook his head.\n\"There you go. You need a place to sleep, Case?\"\n\"I guess so.\"\n\"Come on, then.\" She took his hand. \"We'll get you a coffee\nand something to eat. Take you home. It's good to see you,\nman.\" She squeezed his hand.\nHe smiled.\nSomething cracked.\nSomething shifted at the core of things. The arcade froze,\nvibrated--", "She was gone. The weight of memory came down, an entire body of\nknowledge driven into his head like a microsoft into\na socket. Gone. He smelled burning meat.\nThe sailor in the white t-shirt was gone. The arcade was\nempty, silent. Case turned slowly, his shoulders hunched, teeth\nbared, his hands bunched into involuntary fists. Empty. A\ncrumpled yellow candy wrapper, balanced on the edge of a\nconsole, dropped to the floor and lay amid flattened butts and\nstyrofoam cups.\n\"I had a cigarette,\" Case said, looking down at his white-\nknuckled fist. \"I had a cigarette and a girl and a place to sleep.\nDo you hear me, you son of a bitch? You hear me?\"\nEchoes moved through the hollow of the arcade, fading\ndown corridors of consoles.\nHe stepped out into the street. The rain had stopped.\nNinsei was deserted.\nHolograms flickered, neon danced. He smelled boiled veg-\netables from a vendor's pushcart across the street. An unopened\npack of Yeheyuans lay at his feet, beside a book of matches.\nJULIUS DEANE IMPORT EXPORT. Case staled at the printed\nlogo and its Japanese translation.\n\"Okay,\" he said, picking up the matches and opening the\npack of cigarettes. \"I hear you.\"", "He took his time climbing the stairs of Deane's office. No\nrush, he told himself, no hurry. The sagging face of the Dali\nclock still told the wrong time. There was dust on the Kandinsky\ntable and the Neo-Aztec bookcases. A wall of white fiberglass\nshipping modules filled the room with a smell of ginger.\n\"Is the door locked?\" Case waited for an answer, but none\ncame. He crossed to the office door and tried it. \"Julie?\"\nThe green-shaded brass lamp cast a circle of light on Deane's\ndesk. Case stared at the guts of an ancient typewriter, at cas-\nsettes, crumpled printouts, at sticky plastic bags filled with\nginger samples.\nThere was no one there.\nCase stepped around the broad steel desk and pushed Deane's\nchair out of the way. He found the gun in a cracked leather\nholster fastened beneath the desk with silver tape. It was an\nantique, a .357 Magnum with the barrel and trigger-guard sawn\noff. The grip had been built up with layers of masking tape.\nThe tape was old, brown, shiny with a patina of dirt. He flipped\nthe cylinder out and examined each of the six cartridges. They\nwere handloads. The soft lead was still bright and untarnished.\nWith the revolver in his right hand, Case edged past the\ncabinet to the left of the desk and stepped into the center of\nthe cluttered office, away from the pool of light.\n\"I guess I'm not in any hurry. I guess it's your show. But\nall this shit, you know, it's getting kind of . . . old.\" He raised\nthe gun with both hands, aiming for the center of the desk,\nand pulled the trigger.\nThe recoil nearly broke his wrist. The muzzle-flash lit the\noffice like a flashbulb. With his ears ringing, he stared at the\njagged hole in the front of the desk. Explosive bullet. Azide.\nHe raised the gun again.\n\"You needn't do that, old son,\" Julie said, stepping out of\nthe shadows. He wore a three-piece drape suit in silk her ing-\nbone, a striped shirt, and a bow tie. His glasses winked in the\nlight.\nCase brought the gun around and looked down the line of\nsight at Deane's pink, ageless face.\n\"Don't,\" Deane said. \"You're right. About what this all is.\nWhat I am. But there are certain internal logics to be honored.\nIf you use that, you'll see a lot of brains and blood, and it\nwould take me several hours--your subjective-time--to effect\nanother spokesperson. This set isn't easy for me to maintain.\nOh, and I'm sorry about Linda, in the arcade. I was hoping to\nspeak through her, but I'm generating all this out of your\nmemories, and the emotional charge.... Well, it's very tricky.\nI slipped. Sorry.\"\nCase lowered the gun. \"This is the matrix. You're Winter-\n mute.\"\n- \"Yes. This is all coming to you courtesy of the simstim unit\nwired into your deck, of course. I'm glad I was able to cut you\noff before you'd managed to jack out.\" Deane walked around\nthe desk, straightened his chair, and sat down. \"Sit, old son.\nWe have a lot to talk about.\"\n\"Do we?\"\n\"Of course we do. We have had for some time. I was ready\nwhen I reached you by phone in Istanbul. Time's very short\nnow. You'll be making your run in a matter of days, Case.\"\nDeane picked up a bonbon and stripped off its checkered wrap-\npcr, popped h into his mouth. \"Sit,\" he said around the candy.\nCase lowered himself into the swivel chair in front of the\ndesk without taking his eyes off Deane. He sat with the gun\nin his hand, resting it on his thigh.\n\"Now,\" Deane said briskly, \"order of the day. 'What,' you're\nasking yourself, 'is Wintermute?' Am I right?\"", "\"More or less.\"\n\"An artificial intelligence, but you know that. Your mistake,\nand it's quite a logical one, is in confusing the Winterrnute\nmainframe, Berne, with the Wintermute entity.\" Deane sucked\nhis bonbon noisily. \"You're already aware of the other AI in\nTessier-Ashpool's link-up, aren't you? Rio. I, insofar as I have\nan 'I'--this gets rather metaphysical, you see--I am the one\nwho arranges things for Armitage. Or Corto, who, by the way,\nis quite unstable. Stable enough,\" said Deane and withdrew an\nornate gold watch from a vest pocket and flicked it open, \"For\nthe next day or so.\"\n\"You make about as much sense as anything in this deal\never has,\" Case said, massaging his temples with his free hand.\n\"If you're so goddam smart. . .\"\n\"Why ain't I rich?\" Deane laughed, and nearly choked on\nhis bonbon. \"Well, Case, all I can say to that, and I really\ndon't have nearly as many answers as you imagine I do, is that\nwhat you think of as Wintermute is only a part of another, a,\nshall we say, potential entity. I, let us say, am merely one\naspect of that entity's brain. It's rather like dealing, from your\npoint of view, with a man whose lobes have been severed. Let's\nsay you're dealing with a small part of the man's left brain.\nDifficult to say if you're dealing with the man at all, in a case\nlike that.\" Deane smiled.\n\"Is the Corto story true? You got to him through a micro\nin that French hospital?\"\n\"Yes. And I assembled the file you accessed in London. I\ntry to plan. in your sense of the word, but that isn't my basic\nmode, really. I improvise. It's my greatest talent. I prefer\nsituations to plans, you see.... Really, I've had to deal with\ngivens. I can sort a great deal of information, and sort it very\nquickly. It's taken a very long time to assemble the team you're\na part of. Corto was the first, and he very nearly didn't make\nit. Very far gone, in Toulon. Eating, excreting, and mastur-", "bating were the best he could manage. But the underlying\nstructure of obsessions was there: Screaming Fist, his betrayal\nthe Congressional hearings.\"\n\"Is he still crazy?\"\n\"He's not quite a personality.\" Deane smiled. \"But I'm sure\nyou're aware of that. But Corto is in there, somewhere, and I\ncan no longer maintain that delicate balance. He's going to\ncome apart on you, Case. So I'll be counting on you....\"\n\"That's good, motherfucker,\" Case said, and shot him in\nthe mouth with the .357.\nHe'd been right about the brains. And the blood.", "\"Mon,\" Maelcum was saying, \"I don't like this....\"\n\"It's cool,\" Molly said. \"It's just okay. It's something these\nguys do, is all. Like, he wasn't dead, and it was only a few\nseconds....\"\n\"I saw th' screen, EEG readin' dead. Nothin' movin', forty\nsecond.\"\n\"Well, he's okay now.\"\n\"EEG flat as a strap,\" Maelcum protested."], "10": ["He was numb, as they went through customs, and Molly\ndid most of the talking. Maelcum remained on board Garvey.\nCustoms, for Freeside, consisted mainly of proving your credit.\nThe first thing he saw, when they gained the inner surface of\nthe spindle, was a branch of the Beautiful Girl coffee franchise.\n\"Welcome to the Rue Jules Verne,\" Molly said. \"If you\nhave trouble walking, just look at your feet. The perspective's\na bitch, if you're not used to it.\"\nThey were standing in a broad street that seemed to be the\nfloor of a deep slot or canyon, its either end concealed by subtle\nangles in the shops and buildings that formed its walls. The\nlight, here, was filtered through fiesh green masses of vege-\ntation tumbling from overhanging tiers and balconies that rose\nabove them. The sun. . .\nThere was a brilliant slash of white somewhere above them\ntoo bright, and the recorded blue of a Cannes sky. He knew\nthat sunlight was pumped in with a Lado-Acheson system whose\ntwo-millimeter armature ran the length of the spindle, that they\ngenerated a rotating library of sky effects around it, that if the\nsky were turned off, he'd stare up past the armature of light\nto the curves of lakes, rooftops of casinos, other streets....\nBut it made no sense to his body.\n\"Jesus,\" he said, \"I like this less than SAS.\"\n\"Get used to it. I was a gambler's bodyguard here for a\nmonth.\"\n\"Wanna go somewhere, lie down.\"\n\"Okay. I got our keys.\" She touched his shoulder. \"What\nhappened to you, back there, man? You flatlined.\"\nHe shook his head. \"I dunno, yet. Wait.\"\n\"Okay. We get a cab or something.\" She took his hand and\nled him across Jules Verne, past a window displaying the sea-\nson's Paris furs.\n\"Unreal,\" he said, looking up again.\n\"Nah,\" she responded, assuming he meant the furs, \"grow\nit on a collagen base, but it's mink DNA. What's it matter?\"", "\"It's just a big tube and they pour things through it,\" Molly\nsaid. \"Tourists, hustlers, anything. And there's fine mesh money\nscreens working every minute, make sure the money stays here\nwhen the people fall back down the well.\"\nArmitage had booked them into a place called the Inter-\ncontinental, a sloping glass-fronted clff face that slid down\ninto cold mist and the sound of rapids. Case went out onto\ntheir balcony and watched a trio of tanned French teenagers\nride simple hang gliders a few meters above the spray, triangles\nof nylon in bright primary colors. One of them swung, banked,\nand Case caught a flash of cropped dark hair, brown breasts,\nwhite teeth in a wide smile. The air here smelled of running\nwater and flowers. \"Yeah,\" he said, \"lotta money.\"\nShe leaned beside him against the railing, her hands loose\nand relaxed. \"Yeah. We were gonna come here once, either\nhere or some place in Europe.\"\n\"We who?\"\n\"Nobody,\" she said, giving her shoulders an involuntary\ntoss. \"You said you wanted to hit the bed. Sleep. I could use\nsome sleep.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Case said, rubbing his palms across his cheek-\nbones. \"Yeah, this is some place.\"\nThe narrow band of the Lado Acheson system smoldered\nin absract imitation of some Bermudan sunset, striped by shreds\nof worded cloud. \"Yeah,\" he said, \"sleep.\"\nSleep wouldn't come. When it did, it brought dreams that\nwere like neatly edited segments of memory. He woke re-\npeatedly, Molly curled beside him, and heard the water, voices\ndrifting in through the open glass panels of the balcony, a\nwoman's laughter from the stepped condos on the opposite\nslope. Deane's death kept turning up like a bad card, no matter\nif he told himself that it hadn't been Deane. That it hadn't, in\nfact, happened at all. Someone had once told him that the\namount of blood in the average human body was roughly equiv-\nalent to a case of beer.\nEach time the image of Deane's shattered head struck the\nrear wall of the office, Case was aware of another thought,\nsomething darker, hidden, that rolled away, diving like a fish,\njust beyond his reach.\nLinda.\nDeane. Blood on the wall of the importer's office.\nLinda. Smell of burnt flesh in the shadows of the Chiba\ndome. Molly holding out a bag of ginger, the plastic filmed\nwith blood. Deane had had her killed.\nWintermute. He imagined a little micro whispering to the\nwreck of a man named Corto, the words flowing like a river,\nthe flat personality-substitute called Armitage accreting slowly\nin some darkened ward....The Deane analog had said it\nworked with givens, took advantage of existing situations.\nBut what if Deane, the real Deane, had ordered Linda killed\non Wintermute's orders? Case groped in the dark for a cigarette\nand Molly's lighter. There was no reason to suspect Deane, he\ntold himself, lighting up. No reason.\nWintermute could build a kind of personality into a shell.\nHow subtle a form could manipulation take? He stubbed the\nYeheyuan out in a bedside ashtray after his third puff, rolled\naway from Molly, and tried to sleep.\nThe dream, the memory, unreeled with the monotony of an\nunedited simstim tape. He'd spent a month, his fifteenth sum-\nmer, in a weekly rates hotel, fifth floor, with a girl called\nMarlene. The elevator hadn't worked in a decade. Roaches\nboiled across grayish porcelain in the drain-plugged kitchenette\nwhen you flicked a lightswitch. He slept with Marlene on a\nstriped mattress with no sheets.\nHe'd missed the first wasp, when it built its paperfine gray\nhouse on the blistered paint of the windowframe, but soon the\nnest was a fist-sized lump of fiber, insects hurtling out to hunt\nthe alley below like miniature copters buzzing the rotting con-\ntents of the dumpsters.\nThey'd each had a dozen beers, the afternoon a wasp stung\nMarlene. \"Kill the fuckers,\" she said, her eyes dull with rage\nand the still heat of the room, \"burn 'em.\" Drunk, Case rum-\nmaged in the sour closet for Rollo's dragon. Rollo was Mar-\nlene's previous--and, Case suspected at the time, still\noccasional--boyfriend, an enormous Frisco biker with a blond\nlightning bolt bleached into his dark crewcut. The dragon was\na Frisco flamethrower, a thing like a fat anglehead flashlight.\nCase checked the batteries, shook it to make sure he had enough\nfuel, and went to the open window. The hive began to buzz.\nThe air in the Sprawl was dead, immobile. A wasp shot\nfrom the nest and circled Case's head. Case pressed the ignition\nswitch, counted three, and pulled the trigger. The fuel, pumped\nup to l00 psi, sprayed out past the white-hot coil. A five-meter\ntongue of pale fire, the nest charring, tumbling. Across the\nalley, someone cheered.\n\"Shit!\" Marlene behind him, swaying. \"Stupid! You didn't\nburn 'em. You just knocked it off. They'll come up here and\nkill us!\" Her voice sawing at his nerves, he imagined her en-\ngulfed in flame, her bleached hair sizzling a special green.\nIn the alley, the dragon in hand, he approached the black-\nened nest. It had broken open. Singed wasps wrenched and\nflipped on the asphalt.\nHe saw the thing the shell of gray paper had concealed.\nHorror. The spiral birth factory, stepped terraces of the\nhatching cells, blind jaws of the unborn moving ceaselessly,\nthe staged progress from egg to larva, near-wasp, wasp. In his\nmind's eye, a kind of time-lapse photography took place, re-\nvealing the thing as the biological equivalent of a machine gun,\nhideous in its perfection. Alien. He pulled the trigger, forgetting\nto press the ignition, and fuel hissed over the bulging, writhing\nlife at his feet.\nWhen he did hit the ignition, it exploded with a thump\ntaking an eyebrow with it. Five floors above him, from the\nopen window, he heard Marlene laughing.\nHe woke with the impression of light fading, but the room\nwas dark. Afterimages, retinal flares. The sky outside hinted\nat the start of a recorded dawn. There were no voices now\nonly the rush of water, far down the face of the Intercontinental.\nIn the dream, just before he'd drenched the nest with fuel,\nhe'd seen the T-A logo of Tessier-Ashpool neatly embossed\ninto its side, as though the wasps themselves had worked it\nthere.", "Molly insisted on coating him with bronzer, saying his Sprawl\npallor would attract too much attention.\n\"Christ,\" he said, standing naked in front of the mirror,\n\"you think that looks real?\" She was using the last of the tube\non his left ankle, kneeling beside him.\n\"Nah, but it looks like you care enough to fake it. There.\nThere isn't enough to do your foot.\" She stood, tossing the\nempty tube into a large wicker basket. Nothing in the room\nlooked as though it had been machine-made or produced from\nsynthetics. Expensive, Case knew, but it was a style that had\nalways irritated him. The temperfoam of the huge bed was\ntinted to resemble sand. There was a lot of pale wood and\nhandwoven fabric.\n\"What about you,\" he said, \"you gonna dye yourself brown?\nDon't exactly look like you spend all your time sunbathing.\"\nShe wore loose black silks and black espadrilles. \"I'm an\nexotic. I got a big straw hat for this, too. You, you just wanna\nlook like a cheap-ass hood who's up for what he can get, so\nthe instant tan's okay.\"\nCase regarded his pallid foot morosely, then looked at him-\nself in the mirror. \"Christ. You mind if I get dressed now?\"\nHe went to the bed and began to pull his jeans on. \"You sleep\nokay? You notice any lights?\"\n\"You were dreaming,\" she said.\nThey had breakfast on the roof of the hotel, a kind of meadow\nstudded with striped umbrellas and what seemed to Case an\nunnatural number of trees. He told her about his attempt to\nbuzz the Berne Al. The whole question of bugging seemed to\nhave become academic. If Armitage were tapping them, he'd\nbe doing it through Wintermute.\n\"And it was like real?\" she asked, her mouth full of cheese\ncroissant. \"Like simstim?\"\nHe said it was. \"Real as this,\" he added, looking around.\n\"Maybe more.\"\nThe trees were small, gnarled, impossibly old, the result of\ngenetic engineering and chemical manipulation. Case would\nhave been hard pressed to distinguish a pine from an oak, but\na street boy's sense of style told him that these were too cute,\ntoo entirely and definitively treelike. Between the trees, on\ngentle and too cleverly irregular slopes of sweet green grass,\nthe bright umbrellas shaded the hotel's guests from the unfal-\ntering radiance of the Lado-Acheson sun. A burst of French\nfrom a nearby table caught his attention: the golden children\nhe'd seen gliding above river mist the evening before. Now he\nsaw that their tans were uneven, a stencil effect produced by\nselective melanin boosting, multiple shades overlapping in rec-\ntilinear patterns, outlining and highlighting musculature; the\ngirl's small hard breasts, one boy's wrist resting on the white\nenamel of the table. They looked to Case like machines built\nfor racing; they deserved decals for their hairdressers, the de-\nsigners of their white cotton ducks, for the artisans who'd\ncrafted their leather sandals and simple jewelry. Beyond them,\nat another table, three Japanese wives in Hiroshima sackcloth\nawaited sarariman husbands, their oval faces covered with ar-\ntificial bruises; it was, he knew, an extremely conservative\nstyle, one he'd seldom seen in Chiba.\n\"What's that smell?\" he asked Molly, wrinkling his nose.\n\"The grass. Smells that way after they cut it.\"\nArmitage and Riviera arrived as they were finishing their\ncoffee, Armitage in tailored khakis that made him look as\nthough his regimental patches had just been stripped, Riviera\nin a loose gray seersucker outfit that perversely suggested prison.\n\"Molly, love,\" Riviera said, almost before he was settled\non his chair, \"you'll have to dole me out more of the medicine.\nI'm out.\"\n\"Peter,\" she said, \"and what if I won't?\" She smiled without\nshowing her teeth.\n\"You will,\" Riviera said, his eyes cutting to Armitage and\nback.\n\"Give it to him,\" Armitage said.\n\"Pig for it, aren't you?\" She took a flat, foil-wrapped packet\nfrom an inside pocket and flipped it across the table. Riviera\ncaught it in midair. \"He could off himself,\" she said to Ar-\nmitage.\n\"I have an audition this afternoon,\" Riviera said. \"I'll need\nto be at my best.\" He cupped the foil packd in his uptumed\npalm and smiled. Small glittering insects swarmed out of it,\nvanished. He dropped it into the pocket of his seersucker blouse.\n\"You've got an audition yourself, Case, this afternoon,\"\nArmitage said. \"On that tug. I want you to get over to the pro\nshop and get yourself fitted for a vac suit, get checked out on\nit, and get out to the boat. You've got about three hours.\"\n\"How come we get shipped over in a shitcan and you two\nhire a JAL taxi?\" Case asked, deliberately avoiding the man's\neyes.\n\"Zion suggested we use it. Good cover, when we move. I\ndo have a larger boat, standing by, but the tug is a nice touch.\"\n\"How about me?\" Molly asked. \"I got chores today?\"\n\"I want you to hike up the far end to the axis, work out in\nzero-g. Tomorrow, maybe, you can hike in the opposite di-\nrection.\" Straylight, Case thought.\n\"How soon?\" Case asked, meedng the pale stare.\n\"Soon,\" Armitage said. \"Get going, Case.\"", "\"Mon, you doin' jus' fine,\" Maelcum said, helping Case\nout of the red Sanyo vacuum suit. \"Aerol say you doin' jus'\nfine.\" Aerol had been waiting at one of the sporting docks at\nthe end of the spindle, near the weightless axis. To reach it\nCase had taken an elevator down to the hull and ridden a\nminiature induction train. As the diameter of the spindle nar-\nrowed, gravity decreased; somewhere above him, he'd decided,\nwould be the mountains Molly climbed, the bicycle loop,\nlaunching gear for the hang gliders and miniature microlights.\nAerol had ferried him out to Marcus Garvey in a skeletal\nscooter frame with a chemical engine.\n\"Two hour ago,\" Maelcum said, \"I take delivery of Babylon\ngoods for you; nice lapan-boy inna yacht, mos' pretty yacht.\"\nFree of the suit, Case pulled himself gingerly over the Ho-\nsaka and fumbled into the straps of the web. \"Well,\" he said,\n\"let's see it.\"\nMaelcum produced a white lump of foam slightly smaller\nthan Case's head, fished a pearl-handled switchblade on a green\nnylon lanyard out of the hip pocket of his tattered shorts, and\ncarefully slit the plasdc. He extracted a rectangular object and\npassed it to Case. \"Thas part some gun, mon?\"\n\"No,\" Case said, turning it over, \"but it's a weapon. It's\nvirus.\"\n\"Not on this boy tug, mon,\" Maelcum said firmly, reaching\nfor the steel cassette.\n\"A program. Virus program. Can't get into you, can't even\nget into your software. I've got to interface it through the deck,\nbefore it can work on anything.\"\n\"Well, Japan-mon, he says Hosaka here'll tell you every\nwhat an' wherefore, you wanna know.\"\n\"Okay. Well, you leave me to it, okay?\"\nMaelcum kicked off and drifted past the pilot console, bus-\nying himself with a caulk gun. Case hastily looked away from\nthe waving fronds of transparent caulk. He wasn't sure why,\nbut something about them brought back the nausea of SAS.\n\"What is this thing?\" he asked the Hosaka. \"Parcel for me.\"\n\"Data transfer from Bockris Systems GmbH, Frankfurt, ad-\nvises, under coded transmission, that content of shipment is\nKuang Grade Mark Eleven penetration program. Bockris fur-\nther advises that interface with Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7 is\nentirely compatdble and yields optimal penetradon capabilities,\nparticularly with regard to existing military systems....\"\n\"How about an AI?\"\n\"Existing military systems and artificial intelligences.\"\n\"Jesus Christ. What did you call it?\"\n\"Kuang Grade Mark Eleven.\"\n\"It's Chinese?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Off.\" Case fastened the virus cassette to the side of the\nHosaka with a length of silver tape, remembering Molly's story\nof her day in Macao. Armitage had crossed the border into\nZhongshan. \"On,\" he said, changing his mind. \"Questdon. Who\nowns Bockris, the people in Frankfurt?\"\n\"Delay for interorbital transmission,\" said the Hosaka.\n\"Code it. Standard commerical code.\"\n\"Done.\"\nHe drummed his hands on the Ono-Sendai.\n\"Reinhold Scientdfic A.G., Berne.\"\n\"Do it again. Who owns Reinhold?\"\nIt took three more jumps up the ladder before he reached\nTessier-Ashpool.\n\"Dixie,\" he said, jacking in, \"what do you know about\nChinese virus programs?\"\n\"Not a whole hell of a lot.\"\n\"Ever hear of a grading system like Kuang, Mark Eleven?\"\n\"No.\"\nCase sighed. \"Well, I got a user-friendly Chinese icebreaker\nhere, a one shot cassette. Some people in Frankfurt say it'll\ncut an Al.\"\n\"Possible. Sure. If it's military.\"\n\"Looks like it. Listen, Dix, and gimme the benefit of your\nbackground, okay? Arrnitage seems to be setdng up a run on\nan Al that belongs to Tessier-Ashpool. The mainframe's in\nBerne, but it's linked with another one in Rio. The one in Rio\nis the one that flatlined you, that first time. So it looks like\nthey link via Straylight, the T-A home base, down the end of\nthe spindle, and we're supposed to cut our way in with the\nChinese icebreaker. So if Wintermute's backing the whole show\nit's paying us to burn it. It's burning itself. And something that\ncalls itself Wintermute is trying to get on my good side, get\nme to maybe shaft Annitage. What goes?\"\n\"Motive,\" the construct said. \"Real motive problem, with\nan Al. Not human, see?\"\n\"Well, yeah, obviously.\"\n\"Nope. I mean, it's not human. And you can't get a handle\non it. Me, I'm not human either, but I respond like one. See?\"\n\"Wait a sec,\" Case said. \"Are you sentient, or not?\"\n\"Well, it feels like I am, kid, but I'm really just a bunch of\nROM. It's one of them, ah, philosophical questions, I guess....\"\nThe ugly laughter sensation rattled down Case's spine. \"But I\nain't likely to write you no poem, if you follow me. Your AI,\nit just might. But it ain't no way human.\"\n\"So you figure we can't get on to its motive?\"\n\"It own itself?\"\n\"Swiss citizen, but T-A own the basic software and the\nmainframe.\"\n\"That's a good one,\" the construct said. \"Like, I own your\nbrain and what you know, but your thoughts have Swiss citi-\nzenship. Sure. Lotsa luck, AI.\"\n\"So it's getting ready to burn itself?\" Case began to punch\nthe deck nervously, at random. The matrix blurred, resolved,\nand he saw the complex of pink spheres representing a sikkim\nsteel combine.\n\"Autonomy, that's the bugaboo, where your Al's are con-\ncerned. My guess, Case, you're going in there to cut the hard-\nwired shackles that keep this baby from getting any smarter.\nAnd I can't see how you'd distinguish, say, between a move\nthe parent company makes, and some move the Al makes on\nits own, so that's maybe where the confusion comes in.\" Again\nthe nonlaugh. \"See, those things, they can work real hard, buy\nthemselves time to write cookbooks or whatever, but the min-\nute, I mean the nanosecond, that one starts figuring out ways\nto make itself smarter, Turing'll wipe it. Nobody trusts those\nfuckers, you know that. Every Al ever built has an electro-\nmagnetic shotgun wired to its forehead.\"\nCase glared at the pink spheres of Sikkim.\n\"Okay,\" he said, finally, \"I'm slotting this virus. I want you\nto scan its instruction face and tell me what you think.\"\nThe half sense of someone reading over his shoulder was\ngone for a few seconds, then returned. \"Hot shit, Case. It's a\nslow virus. Take six hours, estimated, to crack a military target.\"\n\"Or an Al.\" He sighed. \"Can we run it?\"\n\"Sure,\" the construct said, \"unless you got a morbid fear\nof dying.\"\n\"Sometimes you repeat yourself, man.\"\n\"It's my nature.\"", "Molly was sleeping when he returned to the Intercontinental.\nHe sat on the balcony and watched a microlight with rainbow\npolymer wings as it soared up the curve of Freeside, its tri-\nangular shadow tracking across meadows and rooftops, until\nit vanished behind the band of the Lado-Acheson system.\n\"I wanna buzz,\" he said to the blue artifice of the sky. \"I\ntruly do wanna get high, you know? Trick pancreas, plugs in\nmy liver, little bags of shit melting, fuck it all. I wanna buzz.\"\nHe left without waking Molly, he thought. He was never\nsure, with the glasses. He shrugged tension from his shoulders\nand got into the elevator. He rode up with an Italian girl in\nspotless whites, cheekbones and nose daubed with something\nblack and nonreflective. Her white nylon shoes had steel cleats;\nthe expensive-looking thing in her hand resembled a cross be-\ntween a miniature oar and an orthopedic brace. She was off\nfor a fast game of something, but Case had no idea what.\nOn the roof meadow, he made his way through the grove\nof trees and umbrellas, until he found a pool, naked bodies\ngleaming against turquoise tiles. He edged into the shadow of\nan awning and pressed his chip against a dark glass plate.\n\"Sushi,\" he said, \"whatever you got.\" Ten minutes later, an\nenthusiastic Chinese waiter arrived with his food. He munched\nraw tuna and rice and watched people tan. \"Christ,\" he said,\nto his tuna, \"I'd go nuts.\"\n\"Don't tell me,\" someone said, \"I know it already. You're\na gangster, right?\"\nHe squinted up at her, against the band of sun. A long young\nbody and a melanin-boosted tan, but not one of the Paris jobs.\nShe squatted beside his chair, dripping water on the tiles.\n\"Cath,\" she said.\n\"Lupus,\" after a pause.\n\"What kind of name is that?\"\n\"Greek,\" he said.\n\"Are you really a gangster?\" The melanin boost hadn't pre-\nvented the formation of freckles.\n\"I'm a drug addict, Cath.\"\n\"What kind?\"\n\"Stimulants. Central nervous system stimulants. Extremely\npowerful central nervous system stimulants.\"\n\"Well, do you have any?\" She leaned closer. Drops of\nchlorinated water fell on the leg of his pants.\n\"No. That's my problem, Cath. Do you know where we\ncan get some?\"\nCath rocked back on her tanned heels and licked at a strand\nof brownish hair that had pasted itself beside her mouth. \"What's\nyour taste?\"\n\"No coke, no amphetamines, but up, gotta be up.\" And so\nmuch for that, he thought glumly, holding his smile for her.\n\"Betaphenethylamine,\" she said. \"No sweat,but it's on your\nchip.\"", "\"You're kidding,\" said Cath's partner and roommate, when\nCase explained the peculiar properties of his Chiba pancreas.\n\"I mean, can't you sue them or something? Malpractice?\" His\nname was Bruce. He looked like a gender switch version of\nCath, right down to the freckles.\n\"Well,\" Case said, \"it's just one of those things, you know?\nLike tissue matching and all that.\" But Bruce's eyes had already\ngone numb with boredom. Got the attention span of a gnat,\nCase thought, watching the boy's brown eyes.\nTheir room was smaller than the one Case shared with Molly,\nand on another level, closer to the surface. Five huge Ciba-\nchromes of Tally Isham were taped across the glass of the\nbalcony, suggesting an extended residency.\n\"They're def triff, huh?\" Cath asked, seeing him eye the\ntransparencies. \"Mine. Shot 'em at the S/N Pyramid, last time\nwe went down the well. She was that close, and she just smiled,\nso natural. And it was bad there, Lupus, day after these Christ\nthe King terrs put angel in the water, you know?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Case said, suddenly uneasy, ' terrible thing.\"\n\"Well,\" Bruce cut in, \"about this beta you want to buy....\"\n\"Thing is, can I metabolize it?\" Case raised his eyebrows.\n\"Tell you what,\" the boy said. \"You do a taste. If your\npancreas passes on it, it's on the house. First time's free.\"\n\"I heard that one before,\" Case said, taking the bright blue\nderm that Bruce passed across the black bedspread.", "\"Case?\" Molly sat up in bed and shook the hair away from\nher lenses.\n\"Who else, honey?\n\"What's got into you?\" The mirrors followed him across\nthe room.\n\"I forget how to pronounce it,\" he said, taking a tightly\nrolled strip of bubble-packed blue derms from his shirt pocket.\n\"Christ,\" she said, \"just what we needed.\"\n\"Truer words were never spoken.\"\n\"I let you out of my sight for two hours and you score.\"\nShe shook her head. \"I hope you're gonna be ready for our\nbig dinner date with Armitage tonight. This Twentieth Century\nplace. We get to watch Riviera strut his stuff, too.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Case said, arching his back, his smile locked into\na rictus of delight, \"beautiful.\"\n\"Man,\" she said, \"if whatever that is can get in past what\nthose surgeons did to you in Chiba, you are gonna be in sad-\nass shape when it wears off.\"\n\"Bitch, bitch, bitch,\" he said, unbuckling his belt. \"Doom.\nGloom. All I ever hear.\" He took his pants off, his shirt, his\nunderwear. \"I think you oughta have sense enough to take\nadvantage of my unnatural state.\" He looked down. \"I mean,\nlook at this unnatural state.\"\nShe laughed. \"It won't last.\"\n\"But it will,\" he said, climbing into the sand-colored tem-\nperfoam, \"that's what's so unnatural about it.\""], "11": ["\"Case, what's wrong with you?\" Armitage said, as the waiter\nwas seating them at his table in the Vingtieme Siecle. It was\nthe smallest and most expensive of several floating restaurants\non a small lake near the Intercontinental.\nCase shuddered. Bruce hadn't said anything about after ef-\nfects. He tried to pick up a glass of ice water, but his hands\nwere shaking. \"Something I ate, maybe.\"\n\"I want you checked out by a medic,\" Armitage said.\n\"Just this hystamine reaction,\" Case lied. \"Get it when I\ntravel, eat different stuff, sometimes.\"\nArmitage wore a dark suit, too formal for the place, and a\nwhite silk shirt. His gold bracelet rattled as he raised his wine\nand sipped. \"I've ordered for you,\" he said.\nMolly and Armitage ate in silence, while Case sawed shakily\nat his steak, reducing it to uneaten bite-sized fragments, which\nhe pushed around in the rich sauce, finally abandoning the\nwhole thing.\n\"Jesus,\" Molly said, her own plate empty, \"gimme that.\nYou know what this costs?\" She took his plate. 'They gotta\nraise a whole animal for years and then they kill it. This isn't\nvat stuff.\" She forked a mouthful up and chewed.\n\"Not hungry,\" Case managed. His brain was deep-fried.\nNo, he decided, it had been thrown into hot fat and left there\nand the fat had cooled, a thick dull grease congealing on the\nwrinkled lobes, shot through with greenish-purple flashes of\npain.\n\"You look fucking awful,\" Molly said cheerfully.\nCase tried the wine. The aftermath of the betaphenethylam-\nine made it taste like iodine.\nThe lights dimmed.\n\"Le Restaurant Vingtieme Siecle,\" said a disembodied voice\nwith a pronounced Sprawl accent, \"proudly presents the hol-\nographic cabaret of Mr. Peter Riviera. \" Scattered applause from\nthe other tables. A waiter lit a single candle and placed it in\nthe center of their table, then began to remove the dishes. Soon\na candle flickered at each of the restaurant's dozen tables, and\ndrinks were being poured.\n\"What's happening?\" Case asked Armitage, who said noth-\ning.\nMolly picked her teeth with a burgundy nail.\n\"Good evening,\" Riviera said, stepping forward on a small\nstage at the far end of the room. Case blinked. In his discomfort,\nhe hadn't noticed the stage. He hadn't seen where Riviera had\ncome from. His uneasiness increased.\nAt first he assumed the man was illuminated by a spotlight.\nRiviera glowed. The light clung around him like a skin, lit\nthe dark hangings behind the stage. He was projecting.\nRiviera smiled. He wore a white dinner jacket. On his lapel,\nblue coals burned in the depths of a black carnation. His fin-\ngernails flashed as he raised his hands in a gesture of greeting,\nan embrace for his audience. Case heard the shallow water lap\nagainst the side of the restaurant.\n\"Tonight,\" Riviera said, his long eyes shining, \"I would\nlike to perform an extended piece for you. A new work.\" A\ncool ruby of light formed in the palm of his upraised right hand.\nHe dropped it. A gray dove fluttered up from the point of\nimpact and vanished into the shadows. Someone whistled. More\napplause.\n\"The title of the work is 'The Doll.'\" Riviera lowered his\nhands. \"I wish to dedicate its premiere here, tonight, to Lady\n3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool.\" A wave of polite ap-\nplause. As it died, Riviera's eyes seemed to find their table.\n\"And to another lady.\"\nThe restaurant's lights died entirely, for a few seconds,\nleaving only the glow of candles. Riviera's holographic aura\nhad faded with the lights, but Case could still see him, standing\nwith his head bowed.\nLines of faint light began to form, verticals and horizontals,\nsketching an open cube around the stage. The restaurant's lights\nhad come back up slightly, but the framework surrounding the\nstage might have been constructed of frozen moonbeams. Head\nbowed, eyes closed, arms rigid at his sides, Riviera seemed to\nquiver with concentration. Suddenly the ghostly cube was filled,\nhad become a room, a room lacking its fourth wall, allowing\nthe audience to view its contents.\nRiviera seemed to relax slightly. He raised his head, but\nkept his eyes closed. \"I'd always lived in the room,\" he said.\n\"I couldn't remember ever having lived in any other room.\"\nThe room's walls were yellowed white plaster. It contained\ntwo pieces of furniture. One was a plain wooden chair, the\nother an iron bedstead painted white. The paint had chipped\nand flaked, revealing the black iron. The mattress on the bed\nwas bare. Stained ticking with faded brown stripes. A single\nbulb dangled above the bed on a twisted length of black wire.\nCase could see the thick coating of dust on the bulb's upper\ncurve. Riviera opened his eyes.\n\"I'd been alone in the room, always.\" He sat on the chair,\nfacing the bed. The blue coals still burned in the black flower\non his lapel. \"I don't know when I first began to dream of\nher,\" he said, \"but I do remember that at first she was only a\nhaze, a shadow.\"\nThere was something on the bed. Case blinked. Gone.\n\"I couldn't quite hold her, hold her in my mind. But I wanted\nto hold her, hold her and more....\" His voice carried perfectly\nin the hush of the restaurant. Ice clicked against the side of a\nglass. Someone giggled. Someone else asked a whispered ques-\ntion in Japanese. \"I decided that if I could visualize some part\nof her, only a small part, if I could see that part perfectly, in\nthe most perfect detail....\"\nA woman's hand lay on the mattress now, palm up, the\nwhite fingers pale.\nRiviera leaned forward, picked up the hand, and began to\nstroke it gently. The fingers moved. Riviera raised the hand to\nhis mouth and began to lick the tips of the fingers. The nails\nwere coated with a burgundy lacquer.\nA hand, Case saw, but not a severed hand; the skin swept\nback smoothly, unbroken and unscarred. He remembered a\ntattooed lozenge of vatgrown flesh in the window of a Ninsei\nsurgical boutique. Riviera was holding the hand to his lips,\nlicking its palm. The fingers tentatively caressed his face. But\nnow a second hand lay on the bed. When Riviera reached for\nit, the fingers of the first were locked around his wrist, a bracelet\nof flesh and bone.\nThe act progressed with a surreal internal logic of its own.\nThe arms were next. Feet. Legs. The legs were very beautiful.\nCase's head throbbed. His throat was dry. He drank the last\nof the wine.\nRiviera was in the bed now, naked. His clothing had been\na part of the projection, but Case couldn't remember seeing it\nfade away. The black flower lay at the foot of the bed, still\nseething with its blue inner flame. Then the torso formed, as\nRiviera caressed it into being, white, headless, and perfect,\nsheened with the faintest gloss of sweat.\nMolly's body. Case stared, his mouth open. But it wasn't\nMolly; it was Molly as Riviera imagined her. The breasts were\nwrong, the nipples larger, too dark. Riviera and the limbless\ntorso writhed together on the bed, crawled over by the hands\nwith their bright nails. The bed was thick now with folds of\nyellowed, rotting lace that crumbled at a touch. Motes of dust\nboiled around Riviera and the twitching limbs, the scurrying,\npinching, caressing hands.\nCase glanced at Molly. Her face was blank; the colors of\nRiviera's projection heaved and turned in her mirrors. Armitage\nwas leaning forward, his hands round the stem of a wineglass,\nhis pale eyes fixed on the stage, the glowing room.\nNow limbs and torso had merged, and Riviera shuddered.\nThe head was there, the image complete. Molly's face, with\nsmooth quicksilver drowning the eyes. Riviera and the Molly-\nimage began to couple with a renewed intensity. Then the image\nslowly extended a clawed hand and extruded its five blades.\nWith a languorous, dreamlike deliberation, it raked Riviera's\nbare back. Case caught a glimpse of exposed spine, but he was\nalready up and stumbling for the door.\nHe vomited over a rosewood railing into the quiet waters\nof the lake. Something that had seemed to close around his\nhead like a vise had released him now. Kneeling, his cheek\nagainst the cool wood, he stared across the shallow lake at the\nbright aura of the Rue Jules Verne.\nCase had seen the medium before; when he'd been a teenager\nin the Sprawl, they'd called it, ''dreaming real.\" He remem-\nbered thin Puerto Ricans under East Side streetlights, dreaming\nreal to the quick beat of a salsa, dreamgirls shuddering and\nturning, the onlookers clapping in time. But that had needed\na van full of gear and a clumsy trode helmet.\nWhat Riviera dreamed, you got. Case shook his aching head\nand spat into the lake.\nHe could guess the end, the finale. There was an inverted\nsymmetry: Riviera puts the dreamgirl together, the dreamgirl\ntakes him apart. With those hands. Dreamblood soaking the\nrotten lace.\nCheers from the restaurant, applause. Case stood and ran\nhis hands over his clothes. He turned and walked back into the\nVingtieme Siecle.\nMolly's chair was empty. The stage was deserted. Armitage\nsat alone, still staring at the stage, the stem of the wineglass\nbetween his fingers.\n\"Where is she?\" Case asked.\n\"Gone,\" Armitage said.\n\"She go after him?\"\n\"No.\" There was a soft tink. Armitage looked down at the\nglass. His left hand came up holding the bulb of glass with its\nmeasure of red wine. The broken stem protruded like a sliver\nof ice. Case took it from him and set it in a water glass.\n\"Tell me where she went, Armitage.\"\nThe lights came up. Case looked into the pale eyes. Nothing\nthere at all. \"She's gone to prepare herself. You won't see her\nagain. You'll be together during the run.\"\n\"Why did Riviera do that to her?\"\nArmitage stood, adjusting the lapels of his jacket. \"Get some\nsleep, Case.\"\n\"We run, tomorrow?\"\nArmitage smiled his meaningless smile and walked away,\ntoward the exit.\nCase rubbed his forehead and looked around the room. The\ndiners were rising, women smiling as men made jokes. He\nnoticed the balcony for the first time, candles still flickering\nthere in private darkness. He heard the clink of silverware,\nmuted conversation. The candles threw dancing shadows on\nthe ceiling.\nThe girl's face appeared as abruptly as one of Riviera's\nprojections, her small hands on the polished wood of the bal-\nustrade; she leaned forward, face rapt, it seemed to him, her\ndark eyes intent on something beyond. The stage. It was a\nstriking face, but not beautiful. Triangular, the cheekbones high\nyet strangely fragile-looking, mouth wide and firm, balanced\noddly by a narrow, avian nose with flaring nostrils. And then\nshe was gone, back into private laughter and the dance of\ncandles.\nAs he left the restaurant, he noticed the two young French-\nmen and their girlfriend, who were waiting for the boat to the\nfar shore and the nearest casino.", "Their room was silent, the temperfoam smooth as some\nbeach after a retreating tide. Her bag was gone. He looked for\na note. There was nothing. Several seconds passed before the\nscene beyond the window registered through his tension and\nunhappiness. He looked up and saw a view of Desiderata,\nexpensive shops: Gucci, Tsuyako, Hermes, Liberty.\nHe stared, then shook his head and crossed to a panel he\nhadn't bothered examining. He turned the hologram off and\nwas rewarded with the condos that terraced the far slope.\nHe picked up the phone and carried it out to the cool balcony.\n\"Get me a number for the Marcus Garvey,\" he told the\ndesk. \"It's a tug, registered out of Zion cluster.\"\nThe chip voice recited a ten-digit number. \"Sir,\" it added\n\"the registration in question is Panamanian.\"\nMaelcum answered on the fifth tone. \"Yo?\"\n\"Case. You got a modem, Maelcum?\"\n\"Yo. On th' navigation comp, ya know.\"\n\"Can you get it off for me, man? Put it on my Hosaka.\nThen turn my deck on. It's the stud with the ridges on it.\"\n\"How you doin' in there, mon?\"\n\"Well, I need some help.\"\n\"Movin', mon. I get th' modem.\"\nCase listened to faint static while Maelcum attached the\nsimple phone link. \"Ice this,\" he told the Hosaka, when he\nheard it beep.\n\"You are speaking from a heavily monitored location,\" the\ncomputer advised primly.\n\"Fuck it,\" he said. \"Forget the ice. No ice. Access the\nconstruct. Dixie?\"\n\"Hey, Case.\" The Flatline spoke through the Hosaka's voice\nchip, the carefully engineered accent lost entirely.\n\"Dix, you're about to punch your way in here and get\nsomething for me. You can be as blunt as you want. Molly's\nin here somewhere and I wanna know where. I'm in 335W,\nthe Intercontinental. She was registered here too, but I don't\nknow what name she was using. Ride in on this phone and do\ntheir records for me.\"\n\"No sooner said,\" the Flatline said. Case heard the white\nsound of the invasion. He smiled. \"Done. Rose Kolodny.\nChecked out. Take me a few minutes to screw their security\nnet deep enough to get a fix.\"\n\"Go.\"\nThe phone whined and clicked with the construct's efforts.\nCase carried it back into the room and put the receiver face up\non the temperfoam. He went into the bathroom and brushed\nhis teeth. As he was stepping back out, the monitor on the\nroom's Braun audiovisual complex lit up. A Japanese pop star\nreclining against metallic cushions. An unseen interviewer asked\na question in German. Case stared. The screen jumped with\njags of blue interference. \"Case, baby, you lose your mind,\nman?\" The voice was slow, familiar.\nThe glass wall of the balcony clicked in with its view of\nDesiderata, but the street scene blurred, twisted, became the\ninterior of the Jarre de The, Chiba, empty, red neon replicated\nto scratched infinity in the mirrored walls.\nLonny Zone stepped forward, tall and cadaverous, moving\nwith the slow undersea grace of his addiction. He stood alone\namong the square tables, his hands in the pockets of his gray\nsharkskin slacks. \"Really, man, you're lookin' very scattered.\"\nThe voice came from the Braun's speakers.\n\"Wintermute,\" Case said.\nThe pimp shrugged languidly and smiled.\n\"Where's Molly?\"\n\"Never you mind. You're screwing up tonight, Case. The\nFlatline's ringing bells all over Freeside. I didn't think you'd\ndo that, man. It's outside the profile.\"\n\"So tell me where she is and I'll call him off.\"\nZone shook his head.\n\"You can't keep too good track of your women, can you\nCase. Keep losin' 'em, one way or another.\"\n\"I'll bring this thing down around your ears,\" Case said.\n\"No. You aren't that kind, man. I know that. You know\nsomething, Case? I figure you've got it figured out that it was\nme told Deane to off that little cunt of yours in Chiba.\"\n\"Don't,\" Case said, taking an involuntary step toward the\nwindow.\n\"But I didn't. What's it matter, though? How much does it\nreally matter to Mr. Case? Quit kidding yourself. I know your\nLinda, man. I know all the Lindas. Lindas are a generic product\nin my line of work. Know why she decided to rip you off?\nLove. So you'd give a shit. Love? Wanna talk love? She loved\nyou. I know that. For the little she was worth, she loved you.\nYou couldn't handle it. She's dead.\"\nCase's fist glanced off the glass.\n\"Don't fuck up the hands, man. Soon you punch deck.\"\nZone vanished, replaced by Freeside night and the lights of\nthe condos. The Braun shut off.\nFrom the bed, the phone bleated steadily.\n\"Case?\" The Flatline was waiting. \"Where you been? I got\nit. but it isn't much.\" The construct rattled off an address.\n\"Place had some weird ice around it for a nightclub. That's all\nI could get without leaving a calling card.\"\n\"Okay,\" Case said. \"Tell the Hosaka to tell Maelcum to\ndisconnect the modem. Thanks, Dix.\"\n\"A pleasure.\"\nHe sat on the bed for a long time, savoring the new thing,\nthe treasure.\nRage.", "\"Hey. Lupus. Hey, Cath, it's friend Lupus.\" Bruce stood\nnaked in his doorway, dripping wet, his pupils enormous. \"But\nwe're just having a shower. You wanna wait? Wanna shower?\"\n\"No. Thanks. I want some help.\" He pushed the boy's arm\naside and stepped into the room.\n\"Hey, really, man, we're...\"\n\"Going to help me. You're really glad to see me. Because\nwe're friends, right? Aren't we?\"\nBruce blinked. \"Sure.\"\nCase recited the address the Flatline had given him.\n\"I knew he was a gangster,\" Cath called cheerfully from\nthe shower.\n\"I gotta Honda trike,\" Bruce said, grinning vacantly.\n\"We go now,\" Case said.", "\"That level's the cubicles,\" Bruce said, after asking Case\nto repeat the address for the eighth time. He climbed back into\nthe Honda. Condensation dribbled from the hydrogen-cell ex-\nhaust as the red fiberglass chassis swayed on chromed shocks.\n\"You be long?\"\n\"No saying. But you'll wait.\"\n\"We'll wait, yeah.\" He scratched his bare chest. \"That last\npart of the address, I think that's a cubicle. Number forty-\nthree.\"\n\"You expected, Lupus?\" Cath craned forward over Bruce's\nshoulder and peered up. The drive had dried her hair.\n\"Not really,\" Case said. \"That's a problem?\"\n\"Just go down to the lowest level and find your friend's\ncubicle. If they let you in, fine. If they don't wanna see you . . .\"\nShe shrugged.\nCase turned and descended a spiral staircase of floral iron.\nSix turns and he'd reached a nightclub. He paused and lit a\nYeheyuan, looking over the tables. Freeside suddenly made\nsense to him. Biz. He could feel it humming in the air. This\nwas it, the local action. Not the high-gloss facade of the Rue\nJules Verne, but the real thing. Commerce. The dance. The\ncrowd was mixed; maybe half were tourists, the other half\nresidents of the islands.\n\"Downstairs,\" he said to a passing waiter, \"I want to go\ndownstairs.\" He showed his Freeside chip. The man gestured\ntoward the rear of the club.\nHe walked quickly past the crowded tables, hearing frag-\nments of half a dozen European languages as he passed.\n\"I want a cubicle,\" he said to the girl who sat at the low\ndesk, a terminal on her lap. \"Lower level.\" He handed her his\nchip.\n\"Gender preference?\" She passed the chip across a glass\nplate on the face of the terminal.\n\"Female,\" he said automatically.\n\"Number thirty-five. Phone if it isn't satisfactory. You can\naccess our special services display beforehand, if you like.\"\nShe smiled. She returned his chip.\nAn elevator slid open behind her.\nThe corridor lights were blue. Case stepped out of the el-\nevator and chose a direction at random. Numbered doors. A\nhush like the halls of an expensive clinic.\nHe found his cubicle. He'd been looking for Molly's; now\nconfused, he raised his chip and placed it against a black sensor\nset directly beneath the number plate.\nMagnetic locks. The sound reminded him of Cheap Hotel.\nThe girl sat up in bed and said something in German. Her\neyes were soft and unblinking. Automatic pilot. A neural cut-\nout. He backed out of the cubicle and closed the door.\nThe door of forty-three was like all the others. He hesitated.\nThe silence of the hallway said that the cubicles were sound-\nproof. It was pointless to try the chip. He rapped his knuckles\nagainst enameled metal. Nothing. The door seemed to absorb\nthe sound.\nHe placed his chip against the black plate.\nThe bolts clicked.\nShe seemed to hit him, somehow, before he'd actually got-\nten the door open. He was on his knees, the steel door against\nhis back, the blades of her rigid thumbs quivering centimeters\nfrom his eyes....\n\"Jesus Christ,\" she said, cuffing the side of his head as she\nrose. \"You're an idiot to try that. How the hell you open those\nlocks, Case? Case? You okay?\" She leaned over him.\n\"Chip,\" he said, struggling for breath. Pain was spreading\nfrom his chest. She helped him up and shoved him into the\ncubicle.\n\"You bribe the help, upstairs?\"\nHe shook his head and fell across the bed.\n\"Breathe in. Count. One, two, three, four. Hold it. Now\nout. Count.\"\nHe clutched his stomach.\n\"You kicked me,\" he managed.\n\"Shoulda been lower. I wanna be alone. I'm meditating,\nright?\" She sat beside him. \"And getting a briefing.\" She pointed\nat a small monitor set into the wall opposite the bed. \"Win-\ntermute's telling me about Straylight.\"\n\"Where's the meat puppet?\"\n\"There isn't any. That's the most expensive special service\nof all.\" She stood up. She wore her leather jeans and a loose\ndark shirt. \"The run's tomorrow, Wintermute says.\"\n\"What was that all about, in the restaurant? How come you\nran?\"\n\"'Cause, if I'd stayed, I might have killed Riviera.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"What he did to me. The show.\"\n\"I don't get it.\"\n\"This cost a lot,\" she said, extending her right hand as\nthough it held an invisible fruit. The five blades slid out, then\nretracted smoothly. \"Costs to go to Chiba, costs to get the\nsurgery, costs to have them jack your nervous system up so\nyou'll have the reflexes to go with the gear.... You know how\nI got the money, when I was starting out? Here. Not here, but\na place like it, in the Sprawl. Joke, to start with, 'cause once\nthey plant the cut-out chip, it seems like free money. Wake up\nsore, sometimes, but that's it. Renting the goods, is all. You\naren't in, when it's all happening. House has software for\nwhatever a customer wants to pay for....\" She cracked her\nknuckles. \"Fine. I was getting my money. Trouble was, the\ncut-out and the circuitry the Chiba clinics put in weren't com-\npatible. So the worktime started bleeding in, and I could re-\nmember it.... But it was just bad dreams, and not all bad.\"\nShe smiled. \"Then it started getting strange.\" She pulled his\ncigarettes from his pocket and lit one. \"The house found out\nwhat I was doing with the money. I had the blades in, but the\nfine neuromotor work would take another three trips. No way\nI was ready to give up puppet time.\" She inhaled, blew out a\nstream of smoke, capping it with three perfect rings. \"So the\nbastard who ran the place, he had some custom software cooked\nup. Berlin, that's the place for snuff, you know? Big market\nfor mean kicks, Berlin. I never knew who wrote the program\nthey switched me to, but it was based on all the classics.\"\n\"They knew you were picking up on this stuff? That you\nwere conscious while you were working?\"\n\"I wasn't conscious. It's like cyberspace, but blank. Silver.\nIt smells like rain.... You can see yourself orgasm, it's like\na little nova right out on the rim of space. But I was starting\nto remember. Like dreams, you know. And they didn't tell me.\nThey switched the software and started renting to specialty\nmarkets.\"\nShe seemed to speak from a distance. \"And I knew, but I\nkept quiet about it. I needed the money. The dreams got worse\nand worse, and I'd tell myself that at least some of them were\njust dreams, but by then I'd started to figure that the boss had\na whole little clientele going for me. Nothing's too good for\nMolly, the boss says, and gives me this shit raise.\" She shook\nher head. \"That prick was charging eight times what he was\npaying me, and he thought I didn't know.\"\n\"So what was he charging for?\"\n\"Bad dreams. Real ones. One night . . . one night, I'd just\ncome back from Chiba.\" She dropped the cigarette, ground it\nout with her heel, and sat down, leaning against the wall.\n\"Surgeons went way in, that trip. Tricky. They must have\ndisturbed the cut-out chip. I came up. I was into this routine\nwith a customer....\" She dug her fingers deep in the foam.\n\"Senator, he was. Knew his fat face right away. We were both\ncovered with blood. We weren't alone. She was all. ..\" She\ntugged at the temperfoam. \"Dead. And that fat prick, he was\nsaying, 'What's wrong. What's wrong?' 'Cause we weren't\nfinished yet....\"\nShe began to shake.\n\"So I guess I gave the Senator what he really wanted, you\nknow?\" The shaking stopped. She released the foam and ran\nher fingers back through her dark hair. \"The house put a con-\ntract out on me. I had to hide for a while.\"\nCase stared at her.\n\"So Riviera hit a nerve last night,\" she said. \"I guess it\nwants me to hate him real bad, so I'll be psyched up to go in\nthere after him.\"\n\"After him?\"\n\"He's already there. Straylight. On the invitation of Lady\n3Jane, all that dedication shit. She was there in a private box,\nkinda . . .\"\nCase remembered the face he'd seen. \"You gonna kill him?\"\nShe smiled. Cold. \"He's going to die, yeah. Soon.\"\n\"I had a visit too,\" he said, and told her about the window,\nstumbling over what the Zone-figure had said about Linda. She\nnodded.\n\"Maybe it wants you to hate something too.\"\n\"Maybe I hate it.\"\n\"Maybe you hate yourself, Case.\"", "\"How was it?\" Bruce asked, as Case climbed into the Honda.\n\"Try it sometime,\" he said, rubbing his eyes.\n\"Just can't see you the kinda guy goes for the puppets,\"\nCath said unhappily, thumbing a fresh derm against her wrist.\n\"Can we go home, now?\" Bruce asked.\n\"Sure. Drop me down Jules Verne, where the bars are.\""], "12": ["Rue Jules Verne was a circumferential avenue, looping the\nspindle's midpoint, while Desiderata ran its length, terminating\nat either end in the supports of the Lado-Acheson light pumps.\nIf you turned right, off Desiderata, and followed Jules Verne\nfar enough, you'd find yourself approaching Desiderata from\nthe left.\nCase watched Bruce's trike until it was out of sight, then\nturned and walked past a vast, brilliantly lit newsstand, the\ncovers of dozens of glossy Japanese magazines presenting the\nfaces of the month's newest simstim stars.\nDirectly overhead, along the nighted axis, the hologram sky\nglittered with fanciful constellations suggesting playing cards,\nthe faces of dice, a top hat, a martini glass. The intersection\nof Desiderata and Jules Verne formed a kind of gulch, the\nbalconied terraces of Freeside cliff dwellers rising gradually to\nthe grassy tablelands of another casino complex. Case watched\na drone microlight bank gracefully in an updraft at the green\nverge of an artificial mesa, lit for seconds by the soft glow of\nthe invisible casino. The thing was a kind of pilotless biplane\nof gossamer polymer, its wings silkscreened to resemble a giant\nbutterfly. Then it was gone, beyond the mesa's edge. He'd\nseen a wink of reflected neon off glass, either lenses or the\nturrets of lasers. The drones were part of the spindle's security\nsystem, controlled by some central computer.\nIn Straylight? He walked on, past bars named the Hi-Lo,\nthe Paradise, le Monde, Cricketeer, Shozoku Smith's, Emer-\ngency. He chose Emergency because it was the smallest and\nmost crowded, but it took only seconds for him to realize that\nit was a tourist place. No hum of biz here, only a glazed sexual\ntension. He thought briefly of the nameless club above Molly's\nrented cubicle, but the image of her mirrored eyes fixed on the\nlittle screen dissuaded him. What was Wintermute revealing\nthere now? The ground plans of the Villa Straylight? The history\nof the Tessier-Ashpools?\nHe bought a mug of Carlsberg and found a place against\nthe wall. Closing his eyes, he felt for the knot of rage, the pure\nsmall coal of his anger. It was there still. Where had it come\nfrom? He remembered feeling only a kind of bafflement at his\nmaiming in Memphis, nothing at all when he'd killed to defend\nhis dealing interests in Night City, and a slack sickness and\nloathing after Linda's death under the inflated dome. But no\nanger. Small and far away, on the mind's screen, a semblance\nof Deane struck a semblance of an office wall in an explosion\nof brains and blood. He knew then: the rage had come in the\narcade, when Wintermute rescinded the simstim ghost of Linda\nLee, yanking away the simple animal promise of food, warmth,\na place to sleep. But he hadn't become aware of it until his\nexchange with the holo-construct of Lonny Zone.\nIt was a strange thing. He couldn't take its measure.\n\"Numb,\" he said. He'd been numb a long time, years. All\nhis nights down Ninsei, his nights with Linda, numb in bed\nand numb at the cold sweating center of every drug deal. But\nnow he'd found this warm thing, this chip of murder. Meat,\nsome part of him said. It's the meat talking, ignore it.\n\"Gangster.\"\nHe opened his eyes. Cath stood beside him in a black shift,\nher hair still wild from the ride in the Honda.\n\"Thought you went home,\" he said, and covered his con-\nfusion with a sip of Carlsberg.\n\"I got him to drop me off at this shop. Bought this.\" She\nran her palm across the fabric, curve of the pelvic girdle. He\nsaw the blue derm on her wrist. \"Like it?\"\n\"Sure.\" He automatically scanned the faces around them,\nthen looked back at her. \"What do you think you're up to,\nhoney?\"\n\"You like the beta you got off us, Lupus?\" She was very\nclose now, radiating heat and tension, eyes slitted over enor-\nmous pupils and a tendon in her neck tense as a bowstring.\nShe was quivering, vibrating invisibly with the fresh buzz.\n\"You get off?\"\n\"Yeah. But the comedown's a bitch.\"\n\"Then you need another one.\"\n\"And what's that supposed to lead to?\"\n\"I got a key. Up the hill behind the Paradise, just the cream-\niest crib. People down the well on business tonight, if you\nfollow me....\"\n\"If I follow you.\"\nShe took his hand between hers, her palms hot and dry.\n\"You're Yak, aren't you, Lupus? Gaijin soldierman for the\nYakuza.\"\n\"You got an eye, huh?\" He withdrew his hand and fumbled\nfor a cigarette.\n\"How come you got all your fingers, then? I thought you\nhad to chop one off every time you screwed up.\"\n\"I never screw up.\" He lit his cigarette.\n\"I saw that girl you're with. Day I met you. Walks like\nHideo. Scares me.\" She smiled too widely. \"I like that. She\nlike it with girls?\"\n\"Never said. Who's Hideo?\"\n\"3Jane's, what she calls it, retainer. Family retainer.\"\nCase forced himself to stare dully at the Emergency crowd\nwhile he spoke. \"Dee-Jane?\"\n\"Lady 3Jane. She's triff. Rich. Her father owns all this.\"\n\"This bar?\"\n\"Freeside ! \"\n\"No shit. You keepin' some class company, huh?\" He raised\nan eyebrow. Put his arm around her, his hand on her hip. \"So\nhow you meet these aristos, Cathy? You some kinda closet\ndeb? You an' Bruce secret heirs to some ripe old credit? Huh?\"\nHe spread his fingers, kneading the flesh beneath the thin black\ncloth. She squirmed against him. Laughed.\n\"Oh, you know,\" she said, lids half lowered in what must\nhave been intended as a look of modesty, \"she likes to party.\nBruce and I, we make the party circuit.... It gets real boring\nfor her, in there. Her old man lets her out sometimes, as long\nas she brings Hideo to take care of her.\"\n\"Where's it get boring?'\n\"Straylight, they call it. She told me, oh, it's pretty, all the\npools and lilies.It's a castle, a real castle, all stone and sunsets.\"\nShe snuggled in against him. \"Hey, Lupus, man, you need a\nderm. So we can be together.\"\nShe wore a tiny leather purse on a slender neck-thong. Her\nnails were bright pink against her boosted tan, bitten to the\nquick. She opened the purse and withdrew a paperbacked bub-\nble with a blue derm inside. Something white tumbled to the\nfloor; Case stooped and picked it up. An origami crane.\n\"Hideo gave it to me,\" she said. \"He tried to show me how,\nbut I can't ever get it right. The necks come out backwards.\"\nShe tucked the folded paper back into her purse. Case watched\nas she tore the bubble away, peeled the derm from its backing,\nand smoothed it across his inner wrist.\n\"3Jane, she's got a pointy face, nose like a bird?\" He watched\nhis hands fumble an outline. \"Dark hair? Young?\"\n\"I guess. But she's triff, you know? Like, all that money.\"\nThe drug hit him like an express train, a white-hot column\nof light mounting his spine from the region of his prostate,\nilluminating the sutures of his skull with x-rays of short-cir-\ncuited sexual energy. His teeth sang in their individual sockets\nlike tuning forks, each one pitch-perfect and clear as ethanol.\nHis bones, beneath the hazy envelope of flesh, were chromed\nand polished, the joints lubricated with a film of silicone. Sand-\nstorms raged across the scoured floor of his skull, generating\nwaves of high thin static that broke behind his eyes, spheres\nof purest crystal, expanding....\n\"Come on,\" she said, taking his hand. \"You got it now.\nWe got it. Up the hill, we'll have it all night.\"\nThe anger was expanding, relentless, exponential, riding\nout behind the betaphenethylamine rush like a carrier wave, a\nseismic fluid, rich and corrosive. His erection was a bar of\nlead. The faces around them in Emergency were painted doll\nthings, the pink and white of mouth parts moving, moving,\nwords emerging like discrete balloons of sound. He looked at\nCath and saw each pore in the tanned skin, eyes flat as dumb\nglass, a tint of dead metal, a faint bloating, the most minute\nasymmetries of breast and collarbone, the--something flared\nwhite behind his eyes.\nHe dropped her hand and stumbled for the door, shoving\nsomeone out of the way.\n\"Fuck you!\" she screamed behind him, \"you ripoff shit!\"\nHe couldn't feel his legs. He used them like stilts, swaying\ncrazily across the flagstone pavement of Jules Verne, a distant\nrumbling in his ears, his own blood, razored sheets of light\nbisecting his skull at a dozen angles.\nAnd then he was frozen, erect, fists tight against his thighs,\nhead back, his lips curled, shaking. While he watched the\nloser's zodiac of Freeside, the nightclub constellations of the\nhologram sky, shift, sliding fluid down the axis of darkness,\nto swarm like live things at the dead center of reality. Until\nthey had arranged themselves, individually and in their hundreds,\nto form a vast simple portrait, stippled the ultimate mono-\nchrome, stars against night sky. Face of Miss Linda Lee.\nWhen he was able to look away, to lower his eyes, he found\nevery other face in the street upraised, the strolling tourists\nbecalmed with wonder. And when the lights in the sky went\nout, a ragged cheer went up from Jules Verne, to echo off the\nterraces and ranked balconies of lunar concrete.\nSomewhere a clock began to chime, some ancient bell out\nof Europe.\nMidnight.", "He walked till morning.\nThe high wore away, the chromed skeleton corroding hourly,\nflesh growing solid, the drug-flesh replaced with the meat of\nhis life. He couldn't think. He liked that very much, to be\nconscious and unable to think. He seemed to become each\nthing he saw: a park bench, a cloud of white moths around an\nantique streetlight, a robot gardener striped diagonally with\nblack and yellow.\nA recorded dawn crept along the Lado-Acheson system,\npink and lurid. He forced himself to eat an omelette in a De-\nsiderata cafe, to drink water, to smoke the last of his cigarettes.\nThe rooftop meadow of the Intercontinental was stirring as he\ncrossed it, an early breakfast crowd intent on coffee and crois-\nsants beneath the striped umbrellas.\nHe still had his anger. That was like being rolled in some\nalley and waking to discover your wallet still in your pocket,\nuntouched. He warmed himself with it, unable to give it a name\nor an object.\nHe rode the elevator down to his level, fumbling in his\npocket for the Freeside credit chip that served as his key. Sleep\nwas becoming real, was something he might do. To lie down\non the sand-colored temperfoam and find the blankness again.\nThey were waiting there, the three of them, their perfect\nwhite sportsclothes and stenciled tans setting off the handwoven\norganic chic of the furniture. The girl sat on a wicker sofa, an\nautomatic pistol beside her on the leaf-patterned print of the\ncushion.\n\"Turing,\" she said. \"You are under arrest.\"", "PART FOUR. THE STRAYLIGHT RUN"], "13": ["\"Your name is Henry Dorsett Case.\" She recited the year\nand place of his birth, his BAMA Single Identification Number,\nand a string of names he gradually recognized as aliases from\nhis past.\n\"You been here awhile?\" He saw the contents of his bag\nspread out across the bed, unwashed clothing sorted by type.\nThe shuriken lay by itself, between jeans and underwear, on\nthe sand-tinted temperfoam.\n\"Where is Kolodny?\" The two men sat side by side on the\ncouch, their arms crossed over tanned chests, identical gold\nchains slung around their necks. Case peered at them and saw\nthat their youth was counterfeit, marked by a certain telltale\ncorrugation at the knuckles, something the surgeons were un-\nable to erase.\n\"Who's Kolodny?\"\n\"That was the name in the register. Where is she?\"\n\"I dunno,\" he said, crossing to the bar and pouring himself\na glass of mineral water. \"She took off.\"\n\"Where did you go tonight, Case?\" The girl picked up the\npistol and rested it on her thigh, without actually pointing it at\nhim.\n\"Jules Verne, couple of bars, got high. How about you?\"\nHis knees felt brittle. The mineral water was warm and flat.\n\"I don't think you grasp your situation,\" said the man on\nthe left, taking a pack of Gitanes from the breast pocket of his\nwhite mesh blouse. \"You are busted, Mr. Case. The charges\nhave to do with conspiracy to augment an artificial intelli-\ngence.\" He took a gold Dunhill from the same pocket and\ncradled it in his palm. \"The man you call Armitage is already\nin custody.\"\n\"Corto?\"\nThe man's eyes widened. \"Yes. How do you know that that\nis his name?\" A millimeter of flame clicked from the lighter.\n\"I forget,\" Case said.\n\"You'll remember,\" the girl said.", "Their names, or worknames, were Michele, Roland, and\nPierre. Pierre, Case decided, would play the Bad Cop; Roland\nwould take Case's side, provide small kindnesses--he found\nan unopened pack of Yeheyuans when Case refused a Gitane--\nand generally play counterpoint to Pierre's cold hostility.\nMichele would be the Recording Angel, making occasional\nadjustments in the direction of the interrogation. One or all of\nthem, he was certain, would be kinked for audio, very likely\nfor simstim, and anything he said or did now was admissible\nevidence. Evidence, he asked himself, through the grinding\ncome-down, of what?\nKnowing that he couldn't follow their French, they spoke\nfreely among themselves. Or seemed to. He caught enough as\nit was: names like Pauley, Armitage, Sense/Net. Panther Mod-\nerns protruding like icebergs from an animated sea of Parisian\nFrench. But it was entirely possible that the names were there\nfor his benefit. They always referred to Molly as Kolodny.\n\"You say you were hired to make a run, Case,\" Roland\nsaid, his slow speech intended to convey reasonableness, \"and\nthat you are unaware of the nature of the target. Is this not\nunusual in your trade? Having penetrated the defenses, would\nyou not be unable then to perform the required operation? And\nsurely an operation of some kind is required, yes?\" He leaned\nforward, elbows on his stenciled brown knees, palms out to\nreceive Case's explanation. Pierre paced the room; now he was\nby the window, now by the door. Michele was the kink, Case\ndecided. Her eyes never left him.\n\"Can I put some clothes on?\" he asked. Pierre had insisted\non stripping him, searching the seams of his jeans. Now he sat\nnaked on a wicker footstool, with one foot obscenely white.\nRoland asked Pierre something in French. Pierre, at the\nwindow again, was peering through a flat little pair of binoc-\nulars. \"Non,\" he said absently, and Roland shrugged, raising\nhis eyebrows at Case. Case decided it was a good time to smile.\nRoland returned the smile.\nOldest cop bullshit in the book, Case thought. \"Look,\" he\nsaid, \"I'm sick. Had this godawful drug in a bar, you know?\nI wanna lie down. You got me already. You say you got\nArmitage. You got him, go ask him. I'm just hired help.\"\nRoland nodded. \"And Kolodny?\"\n\"She was with Armitage when he hired me. Just muscle, a\nrazorgirl. Far as I know. Which isn't too far.\"\n\"You know that Armitage's real name is Corto,\" Pierre said,\nhis eyes still hidden by the soft plastic flanges of the binoculars.\n\"How do you know that, my friend?\"\n\"I guess he mentioned it sometime,\" Case said, regretting\nthe slip. \"Everybody's got a couple names. Your name Pierre?\"\n\"We know how you were repaired in Chiba,\" Michele said,\n\"and that may have been Wintermute's first mistake.\" Case\nstared at her as blankly as he could. The name hadn't been\nmentioned before. \"The process employed on you resulted in\nthe clinic's owner applying for seven basic patents. Do you\nknow what that means?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"It means that the operator of a black clinic in Chiba City\nnow owns a controlling interest in three major medical research\nconsortiums. This reverses the usual order of things, you see.\nIt attracted attention.\" She crossed her brown arms across her\nsmall high breasts and settled back against the print cushion.\nCase wondered how old she might be. People said that age\nalways showed in the eyes, but he'd never been able to see it.\nJulie Deane had had the eyes of a disinterested ten-year-old\nbehind the rose quartz of his glasses. Nothing old about Michele\nbut her knuckles. \"Traced you to the Sprawl, lost you again,\nthen caught up with you as you were leaving for Istanbul. We\nbacktracked, traced you through the grid, determined that you'd\ninstigated a riot at Sense/Net. Sense/Net was eager to cooperate.\nThey ran an inventory for us. They discovered that McCoy\nPauley's ROM personality construct was missing.\"\n\"In Istanbul,\" Roland said, almost apologetically, \"it was\nvery easy. The woman had alienated Armitage's contact with\nthe secret police.\"\n\"And then you came here,\" Pierre said, slipping the bin-\noculars into his shorts pocket. \"We were delighted.\"\n\"Chance to work on your tan?\"\n\"You know what we mean,\" Michele said. \"If you wish to\npretend that you do not, you only make things more difficult\nfor yourself. There is still the matter of extradition. You will\nreturn with us, Case, as will Armitage. But where, exactly,\nwill we all be going? To Switzerland, where you will be merely\na pawn in the trial of an artificial intelligence? Or to le BAMA,\nwhere you can be proven to have participated not only in data\ninvasion and larceny, but in an act of public mischief which\ncost fourteen innocent lives? The choice is yours.\"\nCase took a Yeheyuan from his pack; Pierre lit it for him\nwith the gold Dunhill. \"Would Armitage protect you?\" The\nquestion was punctuated by the lighter's bright jaws snapping\nshut.\nCase looked up at him through the ache and bitterness of\nbetaphenethylamine. \"How old are you, boss?\"\n\"Old enough to know that you are fucked, burnt, that this\nis over and you are in the way.\"\n\"One thing,\" Case said, and drew on his cigarette. He blew\nthe smoke up at the Turing Registry agent. \"Do you guys have\nany real jurisdiction out here? I mean, shouldn't you have the\nFreeside security team in on this party? It's their turf, isn't it?\"\nHe saw the dark eyes harden in the lean boy face and tensed\nfor the blow, but Pierre only shrugged.\n\"It doesn't matter,\" Roland said. \"You will come with us.\nWe are at home with situations of legal ambiguity. The treaties\nunder which our arm of the Registry operates grant us a great\ndeal of flexibility. And we create flexibility, in situations where\nit is required.\" The mask of amiability was down, suddenly,\nRoland's eyes as hard as Pierre's.\n\"You are worse than a fool,\" Michele said, getting to her\nfeet, the pistol in her hand. \"You have no care for your species.\nFor thousands of years men dreamed of pacts with demons.\nOnly now are such things possible. And what would you be\npaid with? What would your price be, for aiding this thing to\nfree itself and grow?\" There was a knowing weariness in her\nyoung voice that no nineteen-year-old could have mustered.\n\"You will dress now. You will come with us. Along with the\none you call Armitage, you will return with us to Geneva and\ngive testimony in the trial of this intelligence. Otherwise, we\nkill you. Now.\" She raised the pistol, a smooth black Walther\nwith an integral silencer.\n\"I'm dressing already,\" he said, stumbling toward the bed.\nHis legs were still numb, clumsy. He fumbled with a clean\nt-shirt.\n\"We have a ship standing by. We will erase Pauley's con-\nstruct with a pulse weapon.\"\n\"Sense/Net'll be pissed,\" Case said, thinking: and all the\nevidence in the Hosaka.\n\"They are in some difficulty already, for having owned such\na thing.\"\nCase pulled the shirt over his head. He saw the shuriken on\nthe bed, lifeless metal, his star. He felt for the anger. It was\ngone. Time to give in, to roll with it.... He thought of the\ntoxin sacs. \"Here comes the meat,\" he muttered.\nIn the elevator to the meadow, he thought of Molly. She\nmight already be in Straylight. Hunting Riviera. Hunted, prob-\nably, by Hideo, who was almost certainly the ninja clone of\nthe Finn's story, the one who'd come to retrieve the talking\nhead.\nHe rested his forehead against the matte black plastic of a\nwall panel and closed his eyes. His limbs were wood, old,\nwarped and heavy with rain.\nLunch was being served beneath the trees, under the bright\numbrellas. Roland and Michele fell into character, chattering\nbrightly in French. Pierre came behind. Michele kept the muz-\nzle of her pistol close to his ribs, concealing the gun with a\nwhite duck jacket she draped over her arm.\nCrossing the meadow, weaving between the tables and the\ntrees, he wondered if she would shoot him if he collapsed now.\nBlack fur boiled at the borders of his vision. He glanced up at\nthe hot white band of the Lado-Acheson armature and saw a\ngiant butterfly banking gracefully against recorded sky.\nAt the edge of the meadow they came to railinged cliffside,\nwild flowers dancing in the updraft from the canyon that was\nDesiderata. Michele tossed her short dark hair and pointed,\nsaying something in French to Roland. She sounded genuinely\nhappy. Case followed the direction of her gesture and saw the\ncurve of planing lakes, the white glint of casinos, turquoise\nrectangles of a thousand pools, the bodies of bathers, tiny bronze\nhieroglyphs, all held in serene approximation of gravity against\nthe endless curve of Freeside's hull.\nThey followed the railing to an ornate iron bridge that arched\nover Desiderata. Michele prodded him with the muzzle of the\nWalther.\n\"Take it easy, I can't hardly walk today.\"\nThey were a little over a quarter of the way across when\nthe microlight struck, its electric engine silent until the carbon\nfiber prop chopped away the top of Pierre's skull.\nThey were in the thing's shadow for an instant; Case felt\nthe hot blood spray across the back of his neck, and then\nsomeone tripped him. He rolled, seeing Michele on her back,\nknees up, aiming the Walther with both hands. That's a waste\nof effort, he thought, with the strange lucidity of shock. She\nwas trying to shoot down the microlight.\nAnd then he was running. He looked back as he passed the\nfirst of the trees. Roland was running after him. He saw the\nfragile biplane strike the iron railing of the bridge, crumple,\ncartwheel, sweeping the girl with it down into Desiderata.\nRoland hadn't looked back. His face was fixed, white, his\nteeth bared. He had something in his hand.\nThe gardening robot took Roland as he passed that same\ntree. It fell straight out of the groomed branches, a thing like\na crab, diagonally striped with black and yellow.\n\"You killed 'em,\" Case panted, running. \"Crazy mother-\nfucker, you killed 'em all....\""], "14": ["The little train shot through its tunnel at eighty kilometers\nper hour. Case kept his eyes closed. The shower had helped,\nbut he'd lost his breakfast when he'd looked down and seen\nPierre's blood washing pink across the white tiles.\nGravity fell away as the spindle narrowed. Case's stomach\nchurned.\nAerol was waiting with his scooter beside the dock.\n\"Case, mon, big problem.\" The soft voice faint in his phones.\nHe chinned the volume control and peered into the Lexan\nface-plate of Aerol's helmet.\n\"Gotta get to Garvey, Aerol.\"\n\"Yo. Strap in, mon. But Garvey captive. Yacht, came be-\nfore, she came back. Now she lockin' steady on Marcus\nGarvey. \"\nTuring? \"Came before?\" Case climbed into the scooter's\nframe and began to fasten the straps.\n\"Japan yacht. Brought you package....\"\nArmitage.", "Confused images of wasps and spiders rose in Case's mind\nas they came in sight of Marcus Garvey. The little tug was\nsnug against the gray thorax of a sleek, insectile ship five times\nher length. The arms of grapples stood out against Garvey's\npatched hull with the strange clarity of vacuum and raw sun-\nlight. A pale corrugated gangway curved out of the yacht,\nsnaked sideways to avoid the tug's engines, and covered the\naft hatch. There was something obscene about the arrangement,\nbut it had more to do with ideas of feeding than of sex.\n\"What's happening with Maelcum?\"\n\"Maelcum fine. Nobody come down the tube. Yacht pilot\ntalk to him, say relax.\"\nAs they swung past the gray ship, Case saw the name HAN-\nIWA in crisp white capitals beneath an oblong cluster of Jap-\nanese.\n\"I don't like this, man. I was thinking maybe it's time we\ngot our ass out of here anyway.\"\n\"Maelcum thinkin' that precise thing, mon, but Garvey not\nbe goin' far like that.\"", "Maelcum was purring a speeded-up patois to his radio when\nCase came through the forward lock and removed his helmet.\n\"Aerol's gone back to the Rocker,\" Case said.\nMaelcum nodded, still whispering to the microphone.\nCase pulled himself over the pilot's drifting tangle of dread-\nlocks and began to remove his suit. Maelcum's eyes were\nclosed now; he nodded as he listened to some reply over a pair\nof phones with bright orange pads, his brow creased with con-\ncentration. He wore ragged jeans and an old green nylon jacket\nwith the sleeves ripped out. Case snapped the red Sanyo suit\nto a storage hammock and pulled himself down to the g-web.\n\"See what th' ghost say, mon,\" Maelcum said. \"Computer\nkeeps askin' for you.\"\n\"So who's up there in that thing?\"\n\"Same Japan-boy came before.

We get any closer now, it'll have\ntracers up our ass and out both ears, be tellin' the boys in the\nT-A boardroom the size of your shoes and how long your dick", "\"This isn't looking so hot, is it? I mean, the Turings are on\nit. I was thinking maybe we should try to bail out. I can take\nyou.\"\n\"Yeah? No shit? You don't wanna see what that Chinese\nprogram can do?\"\n\"Well, I . . .\" Case stared at the green walls of the T-A ice.\n\"Well, screw it. Yeah. We run.\"\n\"Slot it.\"\n\"Hey, Maelcum,\" Case said, jacking out, \"I'm probably\ngonna be under the trodes for maybe eight hours straight.\"\nMaelcum was smoking again. The cabin was swimming in\nsmoke. \"So I can't get to the head....\"\n\"No problem, mon.\" The Zionite executed a high forward\nsomersault and rummaged through the contents of a zippered\nmesh bag, coming up with a coil of transparent tubing and\nsomething else, something sealed in a sterile bubble pack.\nHe called it a Texas catheter, and Case didn't like it at all.\nHe slotted the Chinese virus, paused, then drove it home.\n\"Okay,\" he said, \"we're on. Listen, Maelcum, if it gets\nreally funny, you can grab my left wrist. I'll feel it. Otherwise,\nI guess you do what the Hosaka tells you, okay?\"\n\"Sure, mon.\" Maelcum lit a fresh joint.\n\"And turn the scrubber up. I don't want that shit tangling\nwith my neurotransmitters. I got a bad hangover as it is.\"\nMaelcum grinned.\nCase jacked back in.\n\"Christ on a crutch,\" the Flatline said, \"take a look at this.\"\nThe Chinese virus was unfolding around them. Polychrome\nshadow, countless translucent layers shifting and recombining.\nProtean, enormous, it towered above them, blotting out the\nvoid.\n\"Big mother,\" the Flatline said.\n\"I'm gonna check Molly,\" Case said, tapping the simstim\nswitch.", "Freefall. The sensation was like diving through perfectly\nclear water. She was falling-rising through a wide tube of fluted\nlunar concrete, lit at two-meter intervals by rings of white neon.\nThe link was one way. He couldn't talk to her.\nHe flipped.", "\"Boy, that is one mean piece of software. Hottest thing\nsince sliced bread. That goddam thing's invisible. I just now\nrented twenty seconds on that little pink box, four jumps left\nof the T-A ice; had a look at what we look like. We don't.\nWe're not there.\"\nCase searched the matrix around the Tessier-Ashpool ice\nuntil he found the pink structure, a standard commercial unit,\nand punched in closer to it. \"Maybe it's defective.\"\n\"Maybe, but I doubt it. Our baby's military, though. And\nnew. It just doesn't register. If it did, we'd read as some kind\nof Chinese sneak attack, but nobody's twigged to us at all.\nMaybe not even the folks in Straylight.\"\nCase watched the blank wall that screened Straylight. \"Well,\"\nhe said, \"that's an advantage, right?\"\n\"Maybe.\" The construct approximated laughter. Case winced\nat the sensation. \"I checked ol' Kuang Eleven out again for\nyou, boy. It's real friendly, long as you're on the trigger end,\njus' polite an' helpful as can be. Speaks good English, too.\nYou ever hear of slow virus before?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"I did, once. Just an idea, back then. But that's what ol'\nKuang's all about. This ain't bore and inject, it's more like we\ninterface with the ice so slow, the ice doesn't feel it. The face\nof the Kuang logics kinda sleazes up to the target and mutates,\nso it gets to be exactly like the ice fabric. Then we lock on\nand the main programs cut in, start talking circles 'round the\nlogics in the ice. We go Siamese twin on 'em before they even\nget restless.\" The Flatline laughed.\n\"Wish you weren't so damn jolly today, man. That laugh\nof yours sort of gets me in the spine.\"\n\"Too bad,\" the Flatline said. \"Ol' dead man needs his laughs.\"\nCase slapped the simstim switch.", "And crashed through tangled metal and the smell of dust,\nthe heels of his hands skidding as they struck slick paper.\nSomething behind him collapsed noisily.\n\"C'mon,\" said the Finn, \"ease up a little.\"\nCase lay sprawled across a pile of yellowing magazines,\nthe girls shining up at him in the dimness of Metro Holografix,\na wistful galaxy of sweet white teeth. He lay there until his\nheart had slowed, breathing the smell of old magazines.\n\"Wintermute,\" he said.\n\"Yeah,\" said the Finn, somewhere behind him, \"you got\nit.\"\n\"Fuck off.\" Case sat up, rubbing his wrists.\n\"Come on,\" said the Finn, stepping out of a sort of alcove\nin the wall of junk. \"This way's better for you, man.\" He took\nhis Partagas from a coat pocket and lit one. The smell of Cuban\ntobacco filled the shop. \"You want I should come to you in\nthe matrix like a burning bush? You aren't missing anything,\nback there. An hour here'll only take you a couple of seconds.\"\n\"You ever think maybe it gets on my nerves, you coming\non like people I know?\" He stood, swatting pale dust from the\nfront of his black jeans. He turned, glaring back at-the dusty\nshop windows, the closed door to the street. \"What's out there?\nNew York? Or does it just stop?\"\n\"Well,\" said the Finn, \"it's like that tree, you know? Falls\nin the woods but maybe there's nobody to hear it.\" He showed\nCase his huge front teeth, and puffed his cigarette. \"You can\ngo for a walk, you wanna. It's all there. Or anyway all the\nparts of it you ever saw. This is memory, right? I tap you, sort\nit out, and feed it back in.\"\n\"I don't have this good a memory,\" Case said, looking\naround. He looked down at his hands, turning them over. He\ntried to remember what the lines on his palms were like, but\ncouldn't.\n\"Everybody does,\" the Finn said, dropping his cigarette and\ngrinding it out under his heel, \"but not many of you can access\nit. Artists can, mostly, if they're any good. If you could lay\nthis construct over the reality, the Finn's place in lower Man-\nhattan, you'd see a difference, but maybe not as much as you'd\nthink. Memory's holographic, for you.\" The Finn tugged at\none of his small ears. \"I'm different.\"\n\"How do you mean, holographic?\" The word made him\nthink of Riviera.\n\"The holographic paradigm is the closest thing you've worked\nout to a representation of human memory, is all. But you've\nnever done anything about it. People, I mean.\" The Finn stepped\nforward and canted his streamlined skull to peer up at Case.\n\"Maybe if you had, I wouldn't be happening.\"\n\"What's that supposed to mean?\"\nThe Finn shrugged. His tattered tweed was too wide across\nthe shoulders, and didn't quite settle back into position. \"I'm\ntrying to help you, Case.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Because I need you.\" The large yellow teeth appeared\nagain. \"And because you need me.\"\n\"Bullshit. Can you read my mind, Finn?\" He grimaced.\n\"Wintermute, I mean.\"\n\"Minds aren't read. See, you've still got the paradigms\nprint gave you, and you're barely print-literate. I can access\nyour memory, but that's not the same as your mind.\" He\nreached into the exposed chassis of an ancient television and\nwithdrew a silver-black vacuum tube. \"See this? Part of my\nDNA, sort of....\" He tossed the thing into the shadows and\nCase heard it pop and tinkle. \"You're always building models.\nStone circles. Cathedrals. Pipe-organs. Adding machines. I\ngot no idea why I'm here now, you know that? But if the\nrun goes off tonight, you'll have finally managed the real\nthing.\"\n\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"\n\"That's 'you' in the collective. Your species.\"\n\"You killed those Turings.\"\nThe Finn shrugged. \"Hadda. Hadda. You should give a shit;\nthey woulda offed you and never thought twice. Anyway, why\nI got you here, we gotta talk more. Remember this?\" And his\nright hand held the charred wasps' nest from Case's dream,\nreek of fuel in the closeness of the darkshop. Case stumbled\nback against a wall of junk. \"Yeah. That was me. Did it with\nthe holo rig in the window. Another memory I tapped out of\nyou when I flatlined you that first time. Know why it's im-\nportant?\"\nCase shook his head.\n\"Because\"--and the nest, somehow, was gone--\"it's the\nclosest thing you got to what Tessier-Ashpool would like to\nbe . The human equivalent . Straylight' s like that nest, or anyway\nit was supposed to work out that way. l figure it'll make you\nfeel better.\"\n\"Feel better?\"\n\"To know what they're like. You were starting to hate my\nguts for a while there. That's good. But hate them instead.\nSame difference.\"\n\"Listen,\" Case said, stepping forward, \"they never did shit\nto me. You, it's different....\" But he couldn't feel the anger.\n\"So T-A, they made me. The French girl, she said you were\nselling out the species. Demon, she said I was.\" The Finn\ngrinned. \"It doesn't much matter. You gotta hate somebody\nbefore this is over.\" He turned and headed for the back of the\nshop. \"Well, come on, I'll show you a little bit of Straylight\nwhile I got you here.\" He lifted the corner of the blanket. White\nlight poured out. \"Shit, man, don't just stand there.\"\nCase followed, rubbing his face.\n\"Okay,\" said the Finn, and grabbed his elbow.\nThey were drawn past the stale wool in a puff of dust, into\nfreefall and a cylindrical corridor of fluted lunar concrete, ringed\nwith white neon at two-meter intervals.\n\"Jesus,\" Case said, tumbling.\n\"This is the front entrance,\" the Finn said, his tweed flap-\nping. \"If this weren't a construct of mine, where the shop is\nwould be the main gate, up by the Freeside axis. This'll all be\na little low on detail, though, because you don't have the\nmemories. Except for this bit here, you got off Molly....\"\nCase managed to straighten out, but began to corkscrew in\na long spiral.\n\"Hold on,\" the Finn said, \"I'll fast-forward us.\"\nThe walls blurred. Dizzying sensation of headlong move-\nment, colors, whipping around corners and through narrow\ncorridors. They seemed at one point to pass through several\nmeters of solid wall, a flash of pitch darkness.\n\"Here,\" the Finn said. \"This is it.\"\nThey floated in the center of a perfectly square room, walls\nand ceiling paneled in rectangular sections of dark wood. The\nfloor was covered by a single square of brilliant carpet patterned\nafter a microchip, circuits traced in blue and scarlet wool. In\nthe exact center of the room, aligned precisely with the carpet\npattern, stood a square pedestal of frosted white glass.\n\"The Villa Straylight,\" said a jeweled thing on the pedestal,\nin a voice like music, \"is a body grown in upon itself, a Gothic\nfolly. Each space in Straylight is in some way secret, this\nendless series of chambers linked by passages, by stairwells\nvaulted like intestines, where the eye is trapped in narrow\ncurves, carried past ornate screens, empty alcoves....\"\n\"Essay of 3Jane's,\" the Finn said, producing his Partagas.\n\"Wrote that when she was twelve. Semiotics course.\"\n\"The architects of Freeside went to great pains to conceal\nthe fact that the interior of the spindle is arranged with the\nbanal precision of furniture in a hotel room. In Straylight, the\nhull's inner surface is overgrown with a desperate proliferation\nof structures, forms flowing, interlocking, rising toward a solid\ncore of microcircuitry, our clan's corporate heart, a cylinder\nof silicon wormholed with narrow maintenance tunnels, some\nno wider than a man's hand. The bright crabs burrow there,\nthe drones, alert for micromechanical decay or sabotage.\"\n\"That was her you saw in the restaurant,\" the Finn said.\n\"By the standards of the archipelago,\" the head continued,\n\"ours is an old family, the convolutions of our home reflecting\nthat age. But reflecting something else as well. The semiotics\nof the Villa bespeak a turning in, a denial of the bright void\nbeyond the hull.\n\"Tessier and Ashpool climbed the well of gravity to discover\nthat they loathed space. They built Freeside to tap the wealth\nof the new islands, grew rich and eccentric, and began the\nconstruction of an extended body in Straylight. We have sealed\nourselves away behind our money, growing inward, generating\na seamless universe of self.\n\"The Villa Straylight knows no sky, recorded or otherwise.\n\"At the Villa's silicon core is a small room, the only rec-\ntilinear chamber in the complex. Here, on a plain pedestal of\nglass, rests an ornate bust, platinum and cloisonne, studded\nwith lapis and pearl. The bright marbles of its eyes were cut\nfrom the synthetic ruby viewport of the ship that brought the\nfirst Tessier up the well, and returned for the first Ashpool....\"\nThe head fell silent.\n\"Well?\" Case asked, finally, almost expecting the thing to\nanswer him.\n\"That's all she wrote,\" the Finn said. \"Didn't finish it. Just\na kid then. This thing's a ceremonial terminal, sort of. I need\nMolly in here with the right word at the right time. That's the\ncatch. Doesn't mean shit, how deep you and the Flatline ride\nthat Chinese virus, if this thing doesn't hear the magic word.\"\n\"So what's the word?\"\n\"I don't know. You might say what I am is basically defined\nby the fact that I don't know, because I can't know. I am that\nwhich knoweth not the word. If you knew, man, and told me,\nI couldn't know. It's hardwired in. Someone else has to learn\nit and bring it here, just when you and the Flatline punch\nthrough that ice and scramble the cores.\"\n\"What happens then?\"\n\"I don't exist, after that. I cease.\"\n\"Okay by me,\" Case said.\n\"Sure. But you watch your ass, Case. My, ah, other lobe\nis on to us, it looks like. One burning bush looks pretty much\nlike another. And Armitage is starting to go.\"\n\"What's that mean?\"\nBut the paneled room folded itself through a dozen impos-\nsible angles, tumbling away into cyberspace like an origami\ncrane."], "15": ["\"You tryin' to break my record, son?\" the Flatline asked.\n\"You were braindead again, five seconds.\"\n\"Sit tight,\" Case said, and hit the simstim switch.\nShe crouched in darkness, her palms against rough concrete.\nCASE CASE CASE CASE. The digital display pulsed his\nname in alphanumerics, Wintermute informing her of the link.\n\"Cute,\" she said. She rocked back on her heels and rubbed\nher palms together, cracked her knuckles. \"What kept you?\"\nTIME MOLLY TIME NOW.\nShe pressed her tongue hard against her lower front teeth.\nOne moved slightly, activating her microchannel amps; the\nrandom bounce of photons through the darkness was converted\nto a pulse of electrons, the concrete around her coming up\nghost-pale and grainy. \"Okay, honey. Now we go out to play.\"\nHer hiding place proved to be a service tunnel of some kind.\nShe crawled out through a hinged, ornate grill of tarnished\nbrass. He saw enough of her arms and hands to know that she\nwore the polycarbon suit again. Under the plastic, he felt the\nfamiliar tension of thin tight leather. There was something slung\nunder her arm in a harness or holster. She stood up, unzipped\nthe suit and touched the checkered plastic of a pistolgrip.\n\"Hey, Case,\" she said, barely voicing the words, \"you lis-\ntening? Tell you a story.... Had me this boy once. You kinda\nremind me . . .\" She turned and surveyed the corridor. \"Johnny,\nhis name was.\"\nThe low, vaulted hallway was lined with dozens of museum\ncases, archaic-looking glass-fronted boxes made of brown wood.\nThey looked awkward there, against the organic curves of the\nhallway's walls, as though they'd been brought in and set up\nin a line for some forgotten purpose. Dull brass fixtures held\nglobes of white light at ten-meter intervals. The floor was\nuneven, and as she set off along the corridor, Case realized\nthat hundreds of small rugs and carpets had been put down at\nrandom. In some places, they were six deep, the floor a soft\npatchwork of handwoven wool.\nMolly paid little attention to the cabinets and their contents,\nwhich irritated him. He had to satisfy himself with her disin-\nterested glances, which gave him fragments of pottery, antique\nweapons, a thing so densely studded with rusted nails that it\nwas unrecognizable, frayed sections of tapestry....\n\"My Johnny, see, he was smart, real flash boy. Started out\nas a stash on Memory Lane, chips in his head and people paid\nto hide data there. Had the Yak after him, night I met him,\nand I did for their assassin. More luck than anything else, but\nI did for him. And after that, it was tight and sweet, Case.\"\nHer lips barely moved. He felt her form the words; he didn't\nneed to hear them spoken aloud. \"We had a set-up with a squid,\nso we could read the traces of everything he'd ever stored. Ran\nit all out on tape and started twisting selected clients, ex-clients.\nI was bagman, muscle, watchdog. I was real happy. You ever\nbeen happy, Case? He was my boy. We worked together.\nPartners. I was maybe eight weeks out of the puppet house\nwhen I met him....\" She paused, edged around a sharp turn\nand continued. More of the glossy wooden cases, their sides\na color that reminded him of cockroach wings.\n\"Tight, sweet, just ticking along, we were. Like nobody\ncould ever touch us. I wasn't going to let them. Yakuza, I\nguess, they still wanted Johnny's ass. 'Cause I'd killed their\nman. 'Cause Johnny'd burned them. And the Yak, they can\nafford to move so fucking slow, man, they'll wait years and\nyears. Give you a whole life, just so you'll have more to lose\nwhen they come and take it away. Patient like a spider. Zen\nspiders.\n\"I didn't know that, then. Or if I did, I figured it didn't\napply to us. Like when you're young, you figure you're\nunique. I was young. Then they came, when we were thinking\nwe maybe had enough to be able to quit, pack it in, go to\nEurope maybe. Not that either of us knew what we'd do there,\nwith nothing to do. But we were living fat, Swiss orbital ac-\ncounts and a crib full of toys and furniture. Takes the edge off\nyour game.\n\"So that first one they'd sent, he'd been hot. Reflexes like\nyou never saw, implants, enough style for ten ordinary hoods.\nBut the second one, he was, I dunno, like a monk. Cloned.\nStone killer from the cells on up. Had it in him, death, this\nsilence, he gave it off in a cloud....\" Her voice trailed off as\nthe corridor split, identical stairwells descending. She took the\nleft.\n\"One time, I was a little kid, we were squatting. It was\ndown by the Hudson, and those rats, man, they were big. It's\nthe chemicals get into them. Big as I was, and all night one\nhad been scrabbling under the floor of the squat. Round dawn\nsomebody brought this old man in, seams down his cheeks and\nhis eyes all red. Had a roll of greasy leather like you'd keep\nsteel tools in, to keep the rust off. Spread it out, had this old\nrevolver and three shells. Old man, he puts one bullet in there,\nthen he starts walking up and down the squat, we're hanging\nback by the walls.\n\"Back and forth. Got his arms crossed, head down, like\nhe's forgotten the gun. Listening for the rat. We got real quiet.\nOld man takes a step. Rat moves. Rat moves, he takes another\nstep. An hour of that, then he seems to remember his gun.\nPoints it at the floor, grins, and pulls the trigger. Rolled it back\nup and left.\n\"I crawled under there later. Rat had a hole between its\neyes.\" She was watching the sealed doorways that opened at\nintervals along the corridor. \"The second one, the one who\ncame for Johnny, he was like that old man. Not old, but he\nwas like that. He killed that way.\" The corridor widened. The\nsea of rich carpets undulated gently beneath an enormous can-\ndelabrum whose lowest crystal pendant reached nearly to the\nfloor. Crystal tinkled as Molly entered the hall. THIRD DOOR\nLEFT, blinked the readout.\nShe turned left, avoiding the inverted tree of crystal. \"I just\nsaw him once. On my way into our place. He was coming out.\nWe lived in a converted factory space, lots of young comers\nfrom Sense/Net, like that. Pretty good security to start with,\nand I'd put in some really heavy stuff to make it really tight.\nI knew Johnny was up there. But this little guy, he caught my\neye, as he was coming out. Didn't say a word. We just looked\nat each other and I knew. Plain little guy, plain clothes, no\npride in him, humble. He looked at me and got into a pedicab.\nI knew. Went upstairs and Johnny was sitting in a chair by the\nwindow, with his mouth a little open, like he'd just thought of\nsomething to say.\"\nThe door in front of her was old, a carved slab of Thai teak\nthat seemed to have been sawn in half to fit the low doorway.\nA primitive mechanical lock with a stainless face had been\ninset beneath a swirling dragon. She knelt, drew a tight little\nroll of black chamois from an inside pocket, and selected a\nneedle-thin pick. \"Never much found anybody I gave a damn\nabout, after that.\"\nShe inserted the pick and worked in silence, nibbling at her\nlower lip. She seemed to rely on touch alone; her eyes unfo-\ncused and the door was a blur of blond wood. Case listened\nto the silence of the hall, punctuated by the soft clink of the\ncandelabrum. Candles? Straylight was all wrong. He remem-\nbered Cath's story of a castle with pools and lilies, and 3Jane's\nmannered words recited musically by the head. A place grown\nin upon itself. Straylight smelled faintly musty, faintly per-\nfumed, like a church. Where were the Tessier-Ashpools? He'd\nexpected some clean hive of disciplined activity, but Molly\nhad seen no one. Her monologue made him uneasy; she'd never\ntold him that much about herself before. Aside from her story\nin the cubicle, she'd seldom said anything that had even in-\ndicated that she had a past.\nShe closed her eyes and there was a click that Case felt\nrather than heard. It made him remember the magnetic locks\non the door of her cubicle in the puppet place. The door had\nopened for him, even though he'd had the wrong chip. That\nwas Wintermute, manipulating the lock the way it had manip-\nulated the drone micro and the robot gardener. The lock system\nin the puppet place had been a subunit of Freeside's security\nsystem. The simple mechanical lock here would pose a real\nproblem for the AI, requiring either a drone of some kind or\na human agent.\nShe opened her eyes, put the pick back into the chamois,\ncarefully rerolled it, and tucked it back into its pocket. \"Guess\nyou're kinda like he was,\" she said. \"Think you're born to run.\nFigure what you were into back in Chiba, that was a stripped\ndown version of what you'd be doing anywhere. Bad luck, it'll\ndo that sometimes, get you down to basics.\" She stood, stretched,\nshook herself. \"You know, I figure the one Tessier-Ashpool\nsent after that Jimmy, the boy who stole the head, he must be\npretty much the same as the one the Yak sent to kill Johnny.\"\nShe drew the fletcher from its holster and dialed the barrel to\nfull auto.\nThe ugliness of the door struck Case as she reached for it.\nNot the door itself, which was beautiful, or had once been part\nof some more beautiful whole, but the way it had been sawn\ndown to fit a particular entrance. Even the shape was wrong,\na rectangle amid smooth curves of polished concrete. They'd\nimported these things, he thought, and then forced it all to fit.\nBut none of it fit. The door was like the awkward cabinets,\nthe huge crystal tree. Then he remembered 3Jane's essay, and\nimagined that the fittings had been hauled up the well to flesh\nout some master plan, a dream long lost in the compulsive\neffort to fill space, to replicate some family image of self. He\nremembered the shattered nest, the eyeless things writhing....\nMolly grasped one of the carved dragon's forelegs and the\ndoor swung open easily.\nThe room behind was small, cramped, little more than a\ncloset. Gray steel tool cabinets were backed against a curving\nwall. A light fixture had come on automatically. She closed\nthe door behind her and went to the ranged lockers.\nTHIRD LEFT, pulsed the optic chip, Wintermute overriding\nher time display. FIVE DOWN. But she opened the top drawer\nfirst. It was no more than a shallow tray. Empty. The second\nwas empty as well. The third, which was deeper, contained\ndull beads of solder and a small brown thing that looked like\na human fingerbone. The fourth drawer held a damp-swollen\ncopy of an obsolete technical manual in French and Japanese.\nIn the fifth, behind the armored gauntlet of a heavy vacuum\nsuit, she found the key. It was like a dull brass coin with a\nshort hollow tube braised against one edge. She turned it slowly\nin her hand and Case saw that the interior of the tube was lined\nwith studs and flanges. The letters CHUBB were molded across\none face of the coin. The other was blank.\n\"He told me,\" she whispered. \"Wintermute. How he played\na waiting game for years. Didn't have any real power, then,\nbut he could use the Villa's security and custodial systems to\nkeep track of where everything was, how things moved, where\nthey went. He saw somebody lose this key twenty years ago,\nand he managed to get somebody else to leave it here. Then\nhe killed him, the boy who'd brought it here. Kid was eight.\"\nShe closed her white fingers over the key. \"So nobody would\nfind it.\" She took a length of black nylon cord from the suit's\nkangaroo pocket and threaded it through the round hole above\nCHUBB. Knotting it, she hung it around her neck. \"They were\nalways fucking him over with how old-fashioned they were,\nhe said, all their nineteenth-century stuff. He looked just like\nthe Finn, on the screen in that meat puppet hole. Almost thought\nhe was the Finn, if I wasn't careful.\" Her readout flared the\ntime, alphanumerics superimposed over the gray steel chests.\n\"He said if they'd turned into what they'd wanted to, he\ncould've gotten out a long time ago. But they didn't. Screwed\nup. Freaks like 3Jane. That's what he called her, but he talked\nlike he liked her.\"\nShe turned, opened the door, and stepped out, her hand\nbrushing the checkered grip of the holstered fletcher.\nCase flipped.", "Kuang Grade Mark Eleven was growing.\n\"Dixie, you think this thing'll work?\"\n\"Does a bear shit in the woods?\" The Flatline punched them\nup through shifting rainbow strata.\nSomething dark was forming at the core of the Chinese\nprogram. The density of information overwhelmed the fabric\nof the matrix, triggering hypnagogic images. Faint kaleidoscop-\nic angles centered in to a silver-black focal point. Case watched\nchildhood symbols of evil and bad luck tumble out along trans-\nlucent planes: swastikas, skulls and crossbones dice flashing\nsnake eyes. If he looked directly at that null point, no outline\nwould form. It took a dozen quick, peripheral takes before he\nhad it, a shark thing, gleaming like obsidian, the black mirrors\nof its flanks reflecting faint distant lights that bore no relation-\nship to the matrix around it.\n\"That's the sting,\" the construct said. \"When Kuang's good\nand bellytight with the Tessier-Ashpool core, we're ridin' that\nthrough.\"\n\"You were right, Dix. There's some kind of manual override\non the hardwiring that keeps Wintermute under control. How-\never much he is under control,\" he added.\n\"He,\" the construct said. \"He. Watch that. It. I keep telling\nyou . \"\n\"It's a code. A word, he said. Somebody has to speak it\ninto a fancy terminal in a certain room, while we take care of\nwhatever's waiting for us behind that ice.\"\n\"Well, you got time to kill, kid,\" the Flatline said. \"Ol'\nKuang's slow but steady.\"\nCase jacked out..", "Into Maelcum's stare.\n\"You dead awhile there mon.\"\n\"It happens,\" he said. \"i'm getting used to it.\"\n\"You dealin' wi' th' darkness, mon.\"\n\"Only game in town, it looks like.\"\n\"Jah love, Case,\" Maelcum said, and turned back to his\nradio module. Case stared at the matted dreadlocks, the ropes\nof muscle around the man's dark arms.\nHe jacked back in.\nAnd flipped.", "Molly was trotting along a length of corridor that might\nhave been the one she'd traveled before. The glass-fronted cases\nwere gone now, and Case decided they were moving toward\nthe tip of the spindle; gravity was growing weaker. Soon she\nwas bounding smoothly over rolling hillocks of carpets. Faint\ntwinges in her leg....\nThe corridor narrowed suddenly, curved, split.\nShe turned right and started up a freakishly steep flight of\nstairs, her leg beginning to ache. Overhead, strapped and bun-\ndled cables hugged the stairwell's ceiling like colorcoded gan-\nglia. The walls were splotched with damp.\nShe arrived at a triangular landing and stood rubbing her\nleg. More corridors, narrow, their walls hung with rugs. They\nbranched away in three directions.\nLEFT.\nShe shrugged. \"Lemme look around, okay?\"\nLEFT.\n\"Relax. There's time.\" She started down the corridor that\nled off to her right.\nSTOP\nGO BACK.\nDANGER.\nShe hesitated. From the half-open oak door at the far end\nof the passage came a voice, loud and slurred, like the voice\nof a drunk. Case thought the language might be French, but it\nwas too indistinct. Molly took a step, another, her hand sliding\ninto the suit to touch the butt of her fletcher. When she stepped\ninto the neural disruptor's field, her ears rang, a tiny rising\ntone that made Case think of the sound of her fletcher. She\npitched forward, her striated muscles slack, and struck the door\nwith her forehead. She twisted and lay on her back, her eyes\nunfocused, breath gone.\n\"What's this,\" said the slurred voice, \"fancy dress?\" A trem-\nbling hand entered the front of her suit and found the fletcher,\ntugging it out. \"Come visit, child. Now.\"\nShe got up slowly, her eyes fixed on the muzzle of a black\nautomatic pistol. The man's hand was steady enough, now; the\ngun's barrel seemed to be attached to her throat with a taut,\ninvisible string.\nHe was old, very tall, and his features reminded Case of\nthe girl he had glimpsed in the Vingtieme Siecle. He wore a\nheavy robe of maroon silk, quilted around the long cuffs and\nshawl collar. One foot was bare, the other in a black velvet\nslipper with an embroidered gold foxhead over the instep. He\nmotioned her into the room. \"Slow, darling.\" The room was\nvery large, cluttered with an assortment of things that made no\nsense to Case. He saw a gray steel rack of old-fashioned Sony\nmonitors, a wide brass bed heaped with sheepskins, with pil-\nlows that seemed to have been made from the kind of rug used\nto pave the corridors. Molly's eyes darted from a huge Tele-\nfunken entertainment console to shelves of antique disk re-\ncordings, their crumbling spines cased in clear plastic, to a\nwide worktable littered with slabs of silicon. Case registered\nthe cyberspace deck and the trodes, but her glance slid over it\nwithout pausing.\n\"It would be customary,\" the old man said, \"for me to kill\nyou now.\" Case felt her tense, ready for a move. \"But tonight\nI indulge myself. What is your name?\"\n\"Molly.\"\n\"Molly. Mine is Ashpool.\" He sank back into the creased\nsoftness of a huge leather armchair with square chrome legs,\nbut the gun never wavered. He put her fletcher on a brass table\nbeside the chair, knocking over a plastic vial of red pills. The\ntable was thick with vials, bottles of liquor, soft plastic en-\nvelopes spilling white powders. Case noticed an old-fashioned\nglass hypodermic and a plain steel spoon.\n\"How do you cry, Molly? I see your eyes are walled away.\nI'm curious.\" His eyes were red-rimmed, his forehead gleaming\nwith sweat. He was very pale. Sick, Case decided. Or drugs.\n\"I don't cry, much.\"\n\"But how would you cry, if someone made you cry?\"\n\"I spit,\" she said. \"The ducts are routed back into my mouth.\"\n\"Then you've already learned an important lesson, for one\nso young.\" He rested the hand with the pistol on his knee and\ntook a bottle from the table beside him, without bothering to\nchoose from the half-dozen different liquors. He drank. Brandy.\nA trickle of the stuff ran from the corner of his mouth. \"That\nis the way to handle tears.\" He drank again. \"I'm busy tonight,\nMolly. I built all this, and now I'm busy. Dying.\"\n\"I could go out the way I came,\" she said.\nHe laughed, a harsh high sound. \"You intrude on my suicide\nand then ask to simply walk out? Really, you amaze me. A\nthief.\"\n\"It's my ass, boss, and it's all I got. I just wanna get it out\nof here in one piece.\"\n\"You are a very rude girl. Suicides here are conducted with\na degree of decorum. That's what I'm doing, you understand.\nBut perhaps I'll take you with me tonight, down to hell.... It\nwould be very Egyptian of me.\" He drank again. \"Come here\nthen.\" He held out the bottle, his hand shaking. \"Drink.\"\nShe shook her head.\n\"It isn't poisoned,\" he said, but returned the brandy to the\ntable. \"Sit. Sit on the floor. We'll talk.\"\n\"What about?\" She sat. Case felt the blades move, very\nslightly, beneath her nails.\n\"Whatever comes to mind. My mind. It's my party. The\ncores woke me. Twenty hours ago. Something was afoot, they\nsaid, and l was needed. Were you the something, Molly? Surely\nthey didn't need me to handle you, no. Something else . . . but\nI'd been dreaming, you see. For thirty years. You weren't born,\nwhen last I lay me down to sleep. They told us we wouldn't\ndream, in that cold. They told us we'd never feel cold, either.\nMadness, Molly. Lies. Of course I dreamed. The cold let the\noutside in, that was it. The outside. All the night I built this\nto hide us from. Just a drop, at first, one grain of night seeping\nin, drawn by the cold . . . Others following it, filling my head\nthe way rain fills an empty pool. Calla lilies. I remember. The\npools were terracotta, nursemaids all of chrome, how the limbs\nwent winking through the gardens at sunset.... I'm old, Molly.\nOver two hundred years, if you count the cold. The cold.\" The\nbarrel of the pistol snapped up suddenly, quivering. The ten-\ndons in her thighs were drawn tight as wires now.\n\"You can get freezerburn,\" she said carefully.\n\"Nothing burns there,\" he said impatiently, lowering the\ngun. His few movements were increasingly sclerotic. His head\nnodded. It cost him an effort to stop it. \"Nothing burns. I\nremember now. The cores told me our intelligences are mad.\nAnd all the billions we paid, so long ago. When artificial\nintelligences were rather a racy concept. I told the cores I'd\ndeal with it. Bad timing, really, with 8Jean down in Melbourne\nand only our sweet 3Jane minding the store. Or very good\ntiming, perhaps. Would you know, Molly?\" The gun rose again.\n\"There are some odd things afoot now, in the Villa Straylight.\"\n\"Boss,\" she asked him, \"you know Wintermute?\"\n\"A name. Yes. To conjure with, perhaps. A lord of hell,\nsurely. In my time, dear Molly, I have known many lords.\nAnd not a few ladies. Why, a queen of Spain, once, in that\nvery bed.... But I wander.\" He coughed wetly, the muzzle of\nthe pistol jerking as he convulsed. He spat on the carpet near\nhis one bare foot. \"How I do wander. Through the cold. But\nsoon no more. I'd ordered a Jane thawed, when I woke. Strange,\nto lie every few decades with what legally amounts to one's\nown daughter.\" His gaze swept past her, to the rack of blank\nmonitors. He seemed to shiver. \"Marie-France's eyes,\" he said,\nfaintly, and smiled. \"We cause the brain to become allergic to\ncertain of its own neurotransmitters, resulting in a peculiarly\npliable imitation of autism.\" His head swayed sideways, re-\ncovered. \"I understand that the effect is now more easily ob-\ntained with an embedded microchip.\"\nThe pistol slid from his fingers, bounced on the carpet.\n\"The dreams grow like slow ice,\" he said. His face was\ntinged with blue. His head sank back into the waiting leather\nand he began to snore.\nUp, she snatched the gun. She stalked the room, Ashpool's\nautomatic in her hand.\nA vast quilt or comforter was heaped beside the bed, in a\nbroad puddle of congealed blood, thick and shiny on the pat-\nterned rugs. Twitching a corner of the quilt back, she found\nthe body of a girl, white shoulder blades slick with blood. Her\nthroat had been slit. The triangular blade of some sort of scraper\nglinted in the dark pool beside her. Molly knelt, careful to\navoid the blood, and turned the dead girl's face to the light.\nThe face Case had seen in the restaurant.\nThere was a click, deep at the very center of things, and\nthe world was frozen. Molly's simstim broadcast had become\na still frame, her fingers on the girl's cheek. The freeze held\nfor three seconds, and then the dead face was altered, became\nthe face of Linda Lee.\nAnother click, and the room blurred. Molly was standing,\nlooking down at a golden laser disk beside a small console on\nthe marble top of a bedside table. A length of fiberoptic ribbon\nran like a leash from the console to a socket at the base of the\nslender neck.\n\"I got your number, fucker,\" Case said, feeling his own lips\nmoving, somewhere, far away. He knew that Wintermute had\naltered the broadcast. Molly hadn't seen the dead girl's face\nswirl like smoke, to take on the outline of Linda's deathmask.\nMolly turned. She crossed the room to Ashpool's chair. The\nman's breathing was slow and ragged. She peered at the litter\nof drugs and alcohol. She put his pistol down, picked up her\nfletcher, dialed the barrel over to single shot, and very carefully\nput a toxin dart through the center of his closed left eyelid. He\njerked once, breath halting in mid-intake. His other eye, brown\nand fathomless, opened slowly.\nIt was still open when she turned and left the room."], "16": ["\"Got your boss on hold,\" the Flatline said. \"He's coming\nthrough on the twin Hosaka in that boat upstairs, the one that's\nriding us piggy-back. Called the Haniwa.\"\n\"I know,\" Case said, absently, \"I saw it.\"\nA lozenge of white light clicked into place in front of him,\nhiding the Tessier-Ashpool ice; it showed him the calm, per-\nfectly focused, utterly crazy face of Armitage, his eyes blank\nas buttons. Armitage blinked. Stared.\n\"Guess Wintermute took care of your Turings too, huh?\nLike he took care of mine,\" Case said.\nArmitage stared. Case resisted the sudden urge to look away,\ndrop his gaze. \"You okay, Armitage?\"\n\"Case\"--and for an instant something seemed to move,\nbehind the blue stare--\"you've seen Wintermute, haven't you?\nIn the matrix.\"\nCase nodded. A camera on the face of his Hosaka in Marcus\nGarvey would relay the gesture to the Naniwa monitor. He\nimagined Maelcum listening to his tranced half conversations,\nunable to hear the voices of the construct or Armitage.\n\"Case\"--and the eyes grew larger, Armitage leaning toward\nhis computer--\"what is he, when you see him?\"\n\"A high-rez simstim construct.\"\n\"But who?\"\n\"Finn, last time.... Before that, this pimp I ...\"\n\"Not General Girling?\"\n\"General who?\"\nThe lozenge went blank.\n\"Run that back and get the Hosaka to look it up,\" he told\nthe construct.\nHe flipped.", "The perspective startled him. Molly was crouching between\nsteel girders, twenty meters above a broad, stained floor of\npolished concrete. The room was a hangar or service bay. He\ncould see three spacecraft, none larger than Garvey and all in\nvarious stages of repair. Japanese voices. A figure in an orange\njumpsuit stepped from a gap in the hull of a bulbous construc-\ntion vehicle and stood beside one of the thing's piston-driven,\nweirdly anthropomorphic arms. The man punched something\ninto a portable console and scratched his ribs. A cartlike red\ndrone rolled into sight on gray balloon tires.\nCASE, flashed her chip.\n\"Hey,\" she said. \"Waiting for a guide.\"\nShe settled back on her haunches, the arms and knees of\nher Modern suit the color of the blue-gray paint on the girders.\nHer leg hurt, a sharp steady pain now. \"I shoulda gone back\nto Chin,\" she muttered.\nSomething came ticking quietly out of the shadows, on a\nlevel with her left shouder. It paused, swayed its spherical body\nfrom side to side on high-arched spider legs, fired a micro-\nsecond burst of diffuse laserlight, and froze. It was a Braun\nmicrodrone, and Case had once owned the same model, a\npointless accessory he'd obtained as part of a package deal with\na Cleveland hardware fence. It looked like a stylized matte\nblack daddy longlegs. A red LED began to pulse, at the sphere's\nequator. Its body was no larger than a baseball. \"Okay,\" she\nsaid, \"I hear you.\" She stood up, favoring her left leg, and\nwatched the little drone reverse. It picked its methodical way\nback across its girder and into darkness. She turned and looked\nback at the service area. The man in the orange jumpsuit was\nsealing the front of a white vacuum rig. She watched him ring\nand seal the helmet, pick up his console, and step back through\nthe gap in the construction boat's hull. There was a rising whine\nof motors and the thing slid smoothly out of sight on a ten-\nmeter circle of flooring that sank away into a harsh glare of\narc lamps. The red drone waited patiently at the edge of the\nhole left by the elevator panel.\nThen she was off after the Braun, threading her way between\na forest of welded steel struts. The Braun winked its LED\nsteadily, beckoning her on.\n\"How you doin', Case? You back in Garvey with Maelcum?\nSure. And jacked into this. I like it, you know? Like I've always\ntalked to myself, in my head, when I've been in tight spots.\nPretend I got some friend, somebody I can trust, and I'll tell\n'em what I really think, what I feel like, and then I'll pretend\nthey're telling me what they think about that, and I'll just go\nalong that way. Having you in is kinda like that. That scene\nwith Ashpool . . .\" She gnawed at her lower lip, swinging around\na strut, keeping the drone in sight. \"I was expecting something\nmaybe a little less gone, you know? I mean, these guys are all\nbatshit in here, like they got luminous messages scrawled across\nthe inside of their foreheads or something. I don't like the way\nit looks, I don't like the way it smells....\"\nThe drone was hoisting itself up a nearly invisible ladder\nof U-shaped steel rungs, toward a narrow dark opening. \"And\nwhile I'm feeling confessional, baby, I gotta admit maybe I\nnever much expected to make it out of this one anyway. Been\non this bad roll for a while, and you're the only good change\ncome down since I signed on with Armitage.\" She looked up\nat the black circle. The drone's LED winked, climbing. \"Not\nthat you're all that shit hot.\" She smiled, but it was gone too\nquickly, and she gritted her teeth at the stabbing pain in her\nleg as she began to climb. The ladder continued up through a\nmetal tube, barely wide enough for her shoulders.\nShe was climbing up out of gravity, toward the weightless\naxis.\nHer chip pulsed the time.\n04:23:04 .\nIt had been a long day. The clarity of her sensorium cut the\nbite of the betaphenethylamine, but Case could still feel it. He\npreferred the pain in her leg.", "CASE: O O O O\nO O O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O O O .", "\"Guess it's for you,\" she said, climbing mechanically. The\nzeros strobed again and a message stuttered there, in the corner\nof her vision, chopped up by the display circuit.", "GENERAL G\nIRLING :::\nTRAINED\nCORTO F O R\nSCREAMING\nFIST A N D\nSOLD H I S\nASS TO\nTHE PENT\nAGON::::\nW/MUTE'S\nPRIMARY\nGRIP ON\nARMITAG\nE IS A\nCONSTRU\nCT OF G\nIRLING:\nW/MUTE\nSEZ A'S\nMENTION\nOF G\nMEANS\nHE'S\nCRACK\nING::::\nWATCH\nYOUR\nASS::::\n::DIXIE", "\"Well,\" she said, pausing, taking all of her weight on her\nright leg, \"guess you got problems too.\" She looked down.\nThere was a faint circle of light, no larger than the brass round\nof the Chubb key that dangled between her breasts. She looked\nup. Nothing at all. She tongued her amps and the tube rose\ninto vanishing perspective, the Braun picking its way up the\nrungs. \"Nobody told me about this part,\" she said.\nCase jacked out.", "\"Maelcum . . .\"\n\"Mon, you bossman gone ver' strange.\" The Zionite was\nwearing a blue Sanyo vacuum suit twenty years older than the\none Case had rented in Freeside, its helmet under his arm and\nhis dreadlocks bagged in a net cap crocheted from purple\ncotton yarn. His eyes were slitted with ganja and tension. \"Keep\ncallin' down here wi' orders, mon, but be some Babylon war....\"\nMaelcum shook his head. \"Aerol an' I talkin', an' Aerol talkin'\nwi' Zion, Founders seh cut an' run.\" He ran the back of a large\nbrown hand across his mouth.\n\"Armitage?\" Case winced as the betaphenethylamine hang-\nover hit him with its full intensity, unscreened by the matrix\nor simstim. Brain's got no nerves in it, he told himself, it can't\nreally feel this bad. \"What do you mean, man? He's giving\nyou orders? What?\"\n\"Mon, Armitage, he tellin' me set course for Finland, ya\nknow? He tellin' me there be hope, ya know? Come on my\nscreen wi' his shirt all blood, mon, an' be crazy as some dog,\ntalkin' screamin' fists an' Russian an' th' blood of th' betrayers\nshall be on our hands.\" He shook his head again, the dreadcap\nswaying and bobbing in zero-g, his lips narrowed. \"Founders\nseh the Mute voice be false prophet surely, an' Aerol an' I\nmus' 'bandon Marcus Garvey and return.\"\n\"Armitage, he was wounded? Blood?\"\n\"Can't seh, ya know? But blood, an' stone crazy, Case.\"\n\"Okay,\" Case said, \"So what about me? You're going home.\nWhat about me, Maelcum?\"\n\"Mon,\" Maelcum said, \"you comin' wi' me. I an' I come\nZion wi' Aerol, Babylon Rocker. Leave Mr. Armitage t' talk\nwi' ghost cassette, one ghost t' 'nother....\"\nCase glanced over his shoulder: his rented suit swung against\nthe hammock where he'd snapped it, swaying in the air current\nfrom the old Russian scrubber. He closed his eyes. He saw the\nsacs of toxin dissolving in his arteries. He saw Molly hauling\nherself up the endless steel rungs. He opened his eyes.\n\"I dunno, man,\" he said, a strange taste in his mouth. He\nlooked down at his desk, at his hands. \"I don't know.\" He\nlooked back up. The brown face was calm now, intent. Mael-\ncum's chin was hidden by the high helmet ring of his old blue\nsuit. \"She's inside,\" he said. \"Molly's inside. In Straylight,\nit's called. If there's any Babylon, man, that's it. We leave on\nher, she ain't comin' out, Steppin' Razor or not.\"\nMaelcum nodded, the dreadbag bobbing behind him like a\ncaptive balloon of crocheted cotton. \"She you woman, Case?\"\n\"I dunno. Nobody's woman, maybe.\" He shrugged. And\nfound his anger again, real as a shard of hot rock beneath his\nribs. \"Fuck this,\" he said. \"Fuck Armitage, fuck Wintermute,\nand fuck you. I'm stayin' right here.\"\nMaelcum's smile spread across his face like light breaking.\n\"Maelcum a rude boy, Case. Garvey Maelcum boat.\" His gloved\nhand slapped a panel and the bass-heavy rocksteady of Zion\ndub came pulsing from the tug's speakers. \"Maelcum not run-\nnin', no. I talk wi' Aerol, he certain t' see it in similar light.\"\nCase stared. \"I don't understand you guys at all,\" he said.\n\"Don' 'stan' you, mon,\" the Zionite said, nodding to the\nbeat, \"but we mus' move by Jah love, each one.\"\nCase jacked in and flipped for the matrix.", "\"Get my wire?\"\n\"Yeah.\" He saw that the Chinese program had grown; del-\nicate arches of shifting polychrome were nearing the T-A ice.\n\"Well, it's gettin' stickier,\" the Flatline said. \"Your boss\nwiped the bank on that other Hosaka, and damn near took ours\nwith it. But your pal Wintermute put me on to somethin' there\nbefore it went black. The reason Straylight's not exactly hop-\npin' with Tessier-Ashpools is that they're mostly in cold sleep.\nThere's a law firm in London keeps track of their powers of\nattorney. Has to know who's awake and exactly when. Ar-\nmitage was routing the transmissions from London to Straylight\nthrough the Hosaka on the yacht. Incidently, they know the\nold man's dead.\"\n\"Who knows?\"\n\"The law firm and T-A. He had a medical remote planted\nin his sternum. Not that your girl's dart would've left a res-\nurrection crew with much to work with. Shellfish toxin. But\nthe only T-A awake in Straylight right now is Lady 3Jane\nMarie-France. There's a male, couple years older, in Australia\non business. You ask me, I bet Wintermute found a way to\ncause that business to need this 8Jean's personal attention. But\nhe's on his way home, or near as matters. The London lawyers\ngive his Straylight ETA as 09:00:00, tonight. We slotted Kuang\nvirus at 02:32:03. It's 04:45:20. Best estimate for Kuang pen-\netration of the T-A core is 08:30:00. Or a hair on either side.\nI figure Wintermute's got somethin' goin' with this 3Jane, or\nelse she's just as crazy as her old man was. But the boy up\nfrom Melbourne'll know the score. The Straylight security sys-\ntems keep trying to go full alert, but Wintermute blocks 'em,\ndon't ask me how. Couldn't override the basic gate program\nto get Molly in, though. Armitage had a record of all that on\nhis Hosaka; Riviera must've talked 3Jane into doing it. She's\nbeen able to fiddle entrances and exits for years. Looks to me\nlike one of T-A's main problems is that every family bigwig\nhas riddled the banks with all kinds of private scams and ex-\nceptions. Kinda like your immune system falling apart on you.\nRipe for virus. Looks good for us, once we're past that ice.\"\n\"Okay. But Wintermute said that Arm--\"\nA white lozenge snapped into position, filled with a close-\nup of mad blue eyes. Case could only stare. Colonel Willie\nCorto, Special Forces, Strikeforce Screaming Fist, had found\nhis way back. The image was dim, jerky, badly focused. Corto\nwas using the Haniwa's navigation deck to link with the Hosaka\nin Marcus Garvey.\n\"Case, I need the damage reports on Omaha Thunder.\"\n\"Say, I...Colonel?\"\n\"Hang in there, boy. Remember your training.\"\nBut where have you been, man? he silently asked the an-\nguished eyes. Wintermute had built something called Armitage\ninto a catatonic fortress named Corto. Had convinced Corto\nthat Armitage was the real thing, and Armitage had walked,\ntalked, schemed, bartered data for capital, fronted for Win-\ntermute in that room in the Chiba Hilton.... And now Arm-\nitage was gone, blown away by the winds of Corto's madness.\nBut where had Corto been, those years?\nFalling, burned and blinded, out of a Siberian sky.\n\"Case, this will be difficult for you to accept, I know that.\nYou're an officer. The training. I understand. But, Case, as\nGod is my witness, we have been betrayed.\"\nTears started from the blue eyes.\n\"Colonel, ah, who? Who's betrayed us?\"\n\"General Girling, Case. You may know him by a code name.\nYou do know the man of whom I speak.\"\n\"Yeah,\" Case said, as the tears continued to flow, \"I guess\nI do. Sir,\" he added, on impulse. \"But, sir, Colonel, what\nexactly should we do? Now, I mean.\"\n\"Our duty at this point, Case, lies in flight. Escape. Evasion.\nWe can make the Finnish border, nightfall tomorrow. Treetop\nflying on manual. Seat of the pants, boy. But that will only\nbe the beginning.\" The blue eyes slitted above tanned cheek-\nbones slick with tears. \"Only the beginning. Betrayal from\nabove. From above...\" He stepped back from the camera,\ndark stains on his torn twill shirt. Armitage's face had been\nmasklike, impassive, but Corto's was the true schizoid mask,\nillness etched deep in involuntary muscle, distorting the ex-\npensive surgery.\n\"Colonel, I hear you, man. Listen, Colonel, okay? I want\nyou to open the, ah . . . shit, what's it called, Dix?\"\n\"The midbay lock,\" the Flatline said.\n\"Open the midbay lock. Just tell your central console there\nto open it, right? We'll be up there with you fast, Colonel.\nThen we can talk about getting out of here.\"\nThe lozenge vanished.\n\"Boy, I think you just lost me, there,\" the Flatline said.\n\"The toxins,\" Case said, \"the fucking toxins,\" and jacked\nout.", "\"Poison?\" Maelcum watched over the scratched blue shoul-\nder of his old Sanyo as Case struggled out of the g-web.\n\"And get this goddam thing off me....\" Tugging at the\nTexas catheter. \"Like a slow poison, and that asshole upstairs\nknows how to counter it, and now he's crazier than a shithouse\nrat.\" He fumbled with the front of the red Sanyo, forgetting\nhow to work the seals.\n\"Bossman, he poison you?\" Maelcum scratched his cheek.\n\"Got a medical kit, ya know.\"\n\"Maelcum, Christ, help me with this goddam suit.\"\nThe Zionite kicked off from the pink pilot module. \"Easy,\nmon. Measure twice, cut once, wise man put it. We get up\nthere....\"", "There was air in the corrugated gangway that led from Mar-\ncus Garvey's aft lock to the midbay lock of the yacht called\nHaniwa, but they kept their suits sealed. Maelcum executed\nthe passage with balletic grace, only pausing to help Case,\nwho'd gone into an awkward tumble as he'd stepped out of\nGarvey. The white plastic sides of the tube filtered the raw\nsunlight; there were no shadows.\nGarvey's airlock hatch was patched and pitted, decorated\nwith a laser-carved Lion of Zion. Haniwa's midbay hatch was\ncreamy gray, blank and pristine. Maelcum inserted his gloved\nhand in a narrow recess. Case saw his fingers move. Red LEDs\ncame to life in the recess, counting down from fifty. Maelcum\nwithdrew his hand. Case, with one glove braced against the\nhatch, felt the vibration of the lock mechanism through his suit\nand bones. The round segment of gray hull began to withdraw\ninto the side of Haniwa. Maelcum grabbed the recess with one\nhand and Case with the other. The lock took them with it.", "Haniwa was a product of the Dornier-Fujitsu yards, her\ninterior informed by a design philosophy similar to the one that\nhad produced the Mercedes that had chauffeured them through\nIstanbul. The narrow midbay was walled in imitation ebony\nveneer and floored with gray Italian tiles. Case felt as though\nhe were invading some rich man's private spa by way of the\nshower. The yacht, which had been assembled in orbit, had\nnever been intended for re-entry. Her smooth, wasplike line\nwas simply styling, and everything about her interior was cal-\nculated to add to the overall impression of speed.\nWhen Maelcum removed his battered helmet, Case followed\nhis lead. They hung there in the lock, breathing air that smelled\nfaintly of pine. Under it, a disturbing edge of burning insula-\ntion.\nMaelcum sniffed. \"Trouble here, mon. Any boat, you smell\nthat....\"\nA door, padded with dark gray ultrasuede, slid smoothly\nback into its housing. Maelcum kicked off the ebony wall and\nsailed neatly through the narrow opening, twisting his broad\nshoulders, at the last possible instant, for clearance. Case fol-\nlowed him clumsily, hand over hand, along a waist-high padded\nrail. \"Bridge,\" Maelcum said, pointing down a seamless, cream-\nwalled corridor, \"be there.\" He launched himself with another\neffortless kick. From somewhere ahead, Case made out the\nfamiliar chatter of a printer turning out hard copy. It grew\nlouder as he followed Maelcum through another doorway, into\na swirling mass of tangled printout. Case snatched a length of\ntwisted paper and glanced at it.", "O O O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O O O O\nO O O O O O O O O", "\"Systems crash?\" The Zionite flicked a gloved finger at the\ncolumn of zeros.\n\"No,\" Case said, grabbing for his drifting helmet, \"the Flat-\nline said Armitage wiped the Hosaka he had in there.\"\n\"Smell like he wipe 'em wi' laser, ya know?\" The Zionite\nbraced his foot against the white cage of a Swiss exercise\nmachine and shot through the floating maze of paper, batting\nit away from his face.\n\"Case, mon...\"\nThe man was small, Japanese, his throat bound to the back\nof the narrow articulated chair with a length of some sort of\nfine steel wire. The wire was invisible, where it crossed the\nblack temperfoam of the headrest, and it had cut as deeply into\nhis larynx. A single sphere of dark blood had congealed there\nlike some strange precious stone, a red-black pearl. Case saw\nthe crude wooden handles that drifted at either end of the\ngarrotte, like worn sections of broom handle.\n\"Wonder how long he had that on him?\" Case said, re-\nmembering Corto's postwar pilgrimage.\n\"He know how pilot boat, Case, bossman?\"\n\"Maybe. He was Special Forces.\"\n\"Well, this Japan-boy, he not be pilotin'. Doubt I pilot her\neasy myself. Ver' new boat. . .\"\n\"So find us the bridge.\"\nMaelcum frowned, rolled backward, and kicked.\nCase followed him into a larger space, a kind of lounge,\nshredding and crumpling the lengths of printout that snared him\nin his passage. There were more of the articulated chairs, here,\nsomething that resembled a bar, and the Hosaka. The printer,\nstill spewing its flimsy tongue of paper, was an in-built bulk-\nhead unit, a neat slot in a panel of handrubbed veneer. He\npulled himself over the circle of chairs and reached it, punching\na white stud to the left of the slot. The chattering stopped. He\nturned and stared at the Hosaka. Its face had been drilled through,\nat least a dozen times. The holes were small, circular, edges\nblackened. Tiny spheres of bright alloy were orbiting the dead\ncomputer. \"Good guess,\" he said to Maelcum.\n\"Bridge locked, mon,\" Maelcum said, from the opposite\nside of the lounge.\nThe lights dimmed, surged, dimmed again.\nCase ripped the printout from its slot. More zeros. \"Win-\ntermute?\" He looked around the beige and brown lounge, the\nspace scrawled with drifting curves of paper. \"That you on the\nlights, Wintermute?\"\nA panel beside Maelcum's head slid up, revealing a small\nmonitor. Maelcum jerked apprehensively, wiped sweat from\nhis forehead with a foam patch on the back of a gloved hand,\nand swung to study the display. \"You read Japanese, mon?\"\nCase could see figures blinking past on the screen.\n\"No,\" Case said.\n\"Bridge is escape pod, lifeboat. Countin' down, looks like\nit. Suit up now.\" He ringed his helmet and slapped at the seals.\n\"What? He's takin' off? Shit!\" He kicked off from the\nbulkhead and shot through the tangle of printout. \"We gotta\nopen this door, man!\" But Maelcum could only tap the side of\nhis helmet. Case could see his lips moving, through the Lexan.\nHe saw a bead of sweat arc out from the rainbow braided band\nof the purple cotton net the Zionite wore over his locks. Mael-\ncum snatched the helmet from Case and ringed it for him\nsmoothly, the palms of his gloves smacking the seals. Micro-\nLED monitors to the left of the faceplate lit as the neck ring\nconnections closed. \"No seh Japanese,\" Maelcum said, over\nhis suit's transceiver, \"but countdown's wrong.\" He tapped a\nparticular line on the screen. \"Seals not intact, bridge module.\nLaunchin' wi' lock open.\"\n\"Armitage!\" Case tried to pound on the door. The physics\nof zero-g sent him tumbling back through the printout. \"Corto!\nDon't do it! We gotta talk! We gotta--\"\n\"Case? Read you, Case...\" The voice barely resembled\nArmitage's now. It held a weird calm. Case stopped kicking.\nHis helmet struck the far wall. \"I'm sorry, Case, but it has to\nbe this way. One of us has to get out. One of us has to testify.\nIf we all go down here, it ends here. I'll tell them, Case, I'll\ntell them all of it. About Girling and the others. And I'll make\nit, Case. I know I'll make it. To Helsinki.\" There was a sudden\nsilence; Case felt it fill his helmet like some rare gas. \"But it's\nso hard, Case, so goddam hard. I'm blind.\"\n\"Corto, stop. Wait. You're blind, man. You can't fly! You'll\nhit the fucking trees. And they're trying to get you, Corto, I\nswear to God, they've left your hatch open. You'll die, and\nyou'll never get to tell 'em, and I gotta get the enzyme, name\nof the enzyme, the enzyme, man....\" He was shouting, voice\nhigh with hysteria. Feedback shrilled out of the helmet's phone\npads.\n\"Remember the training, Case. That's all we can do.\"\nAnd then the helmet filled with a confused babble, roaring\nstatic, harmonics howling down the years from Screaming Fist.\nFragments of Russian, and then a stranger's voice, Midwestern,\nvery young. \"We are down, repeat, Omaha Thunder is down,\nwe . . .\"\n\"Wintermute,\" Case screamed, \"don't do this to me!\" Tears\nbroke from his lashes, rebounding off the faceplate in wobbling\ncrystal droplets. Then Haniwa thudded, once, shivered as if\nsome huge soft thing had struck her hull. Case imagined the\nlifeboat jolting free,, blown clear by explosive bolts, a second's\nclawing hurricane of escaping air tearing mad Colonel Corto\nfrom his couch, from Wintermute's rendition of the final minute\nof Screaming Fist.\n\"'Im gone, mon.\" Maelcum looked at the monitor. \"Hatch\nopen. Mute mus' override ejection failsafe.\"\nCase tried to wipe the tears of rage from his eyes. His fingers\nclacked against Lexan.\n\"Yacht, she tight for air, but bossman takin' grapple control\nwi' bridge. Marcus Garvey still stuck.\"\nBut Case was seeing Armitage's endless fall around Free-\nside, through vacuum colder than the steppes.

Count on it.\"\n\"I don't exactly trust Wintermute to give it to me.\"\nThe construct's hideous approximation of laughter scraped\nCase's nerves like a dull blade. \"Maybe that means you're\ngettin' smart.\"\nHe hit the simstim switch."], "18": ["She missed it by a fraction. She nearly cut it, but not quite.\nShe went in just right, Case thought. The right attitude; it was\nsomething he could sense, something he could have seen in\nthe posture of another cowboy leaning into a deck, fingers\nflying across the board. She had it: the thing, the moves. And\nshe'd pulled it all together for her entrance. Pulled it together\naround the pain in her leg and marched down 3Jane's stairs\nlike she owned the place, elbow of her gun arm at her hip,\nforearm up, wrist relaxed, swaying the muzzle of the fletcher\nwith the studied nonchalance of a Regency duelist.\nIt was a performance. It was like the culmination of a life-\ntime's observation of martial arts tapes, cheap ones, the kind\nCase had grown up on For a few seconds, he knew, she was\nevery bad-ass hero, Sony Mao in the old Shaw videos, Mickey\nChiba, the whole lineage back to Lee and Eastwood. She was\nwalking it the way she talked it.\nLady 3Jane Marie-France Tessier-Ashpool had carved her-\nself a low country flush with the inner surface of Straylight's\nhull, chopping away the maze of walls that was her legacy.\nShe lived in a single room so broad and deep that its far reaches\nwere lost to an inverse horizon, the floor hidden by the cur-\nvature of the spindle. The ceiling was low and irregular, done\nin the same imitation stone that walled the corridor. Here and\nthere across the floor were jagged sections of wall, waist-high\nreminders of the labyrinth. There was a rectangular turquoise\npool centered ten meters from the foot of the stairway, its\nunderwater floods the apartment's only source of light--or it\nseemed that way, to Case, as Molly took her final step. The\npool threw shifting blobs of light across the ceiling above it.\nThey were waiting by the pool.\nHe'd known that her reflexes were souped up, jazzed by\nthe neurosurgeons for combat, but he hadn't experienced them\non the simstim link. The effect was like tape run at half speed,\na slow, deliberate dance choreographed to the killer instinct\nand years of training. She seemed to take the three of them in\nat a glance: the boy poised on the pool's high board, the girl\ngrinning ove her wineglass, and the corpse of Ashpool, his\nleft socket gaping black and corrupt above his welcoming smile.\nHe wore his maroon robe. His teeth were very white.\nThe boy dove. Slender, brown, his form perfect. The gre-\nnade left her hand before his hands could cut the water. Case\nknew the thing for what it was as it broke the surface: a core\nof high explosive wrapped with ten meters of fine, brittle steel\nwire.\nHer fletcher whined as she sent a storm of explosive darts\ninto Ashpool's face and chest, and he was gone, smoke curling\nfrom the pocked back of the empty, white-enameled pool chair.\nThe muzzle swung for 3Jane as the grenade detonated, a\nsymmetrical wedding cake of water rising, breaking, falling\nback, but the mistake had been made.\nHideo didn't even touch her, then. Her leg collapsed.\nIn Garvey, Case screamed.", "\"It took you long enough,\" Riviera said, as he searched her\npockets. Her hands vanished at the wrists in a matte black\nsphere the size of a bowling ball. \"I saw a multiple assassination\nin Ankara,\" he said, his fingers plucking things from her jacket,\n\"a grenade job. In a pool. It seemed a very weak explosion,\nbut they all died instantly of hydrostatic shock.\" Case felt her\nmove her fingers experimentally. The material of the ball seemed\nto offer no more resistance than temperfoam. The pain in her\nleg was excruciating, impossible. A red moire shifted in her\nvision. \"I wouldn't move them, if I were you.\" The interior\nof the ball seemed to tighten slightly. \"It' s a sex toy Jane bought\nin Berlin. Wiggle them long enough and it crushes them to a\npulp. Variant of the material they make this flooring from.\nSomething to do with the molecules, I suppose. Are you in\npain?\"\nShe groaned.\n\"You seem to have injured your leg.\" His fingers found the\nflat packet of drugs in the left back pocket of her jeans. \"Well.\nMy last taste from Ali, and just in time.\"\nThe shifting mesh of blood began to whirl.\n\"Hideo,\" said another voice, a woman's, \"she's losing con-\nsciousness. Give her something. For that and for the pain. She's\nvery striking, don't you think, Peter? These glasses, are they\na fashion where she comes from?\"\nCool hands, unhurried, with a surgeon's certainty.

And once we\nsent Hideo. My fault, really. I'd let someone in, a burglar. He\ntook the family terminal.\" She laughed. \"I made it easy for\nhim. To annoy the others. He was a pretty boy, my burglar.\nIs she waking, Hideo? Shouldn't she have more?\"\n\"More and she would die,\" said a third voice.\nThe blood mesh slid into black.\nThe music returned, horns and piano.

The Finn, against a background\nof twisted, impacted junk. \"Neither do 1.

You can keep track of the program by\njacking your deck into the Straylight system. I'll handle it for\nyou. There's a standard jack in the back of the head, behind\na panel with five zircons.\"\n\"Kill Riviera'!\"\n\"Kill him.\"\nCase blinked at the representation of the Finn. He felt Mael-\ncum put his hand on his shoulder. \"Hey. You forget some-\nthing.\" He felt the rage rising, and a kind of glee. \"You fucked\nup. You blew the controls on the grapples when you blew\nArmitage. Haniwa's got us good and tight. Armitage fried the\nother Hosaka and the mainframes went with the bridge, right?\"\nThe Finn nodded.\n\"So we're stuck out here. And that means you're fucked\nman.\" He wanted to laugh, but it caught in his throat.\n\"Case, mon,\" Maelcum said softly, \"Garvey a tug.\"\n\"That's right,\" said the Finn, and smiled.", "\"You havin' fun in the big world outside?\" the construct\nasked, when Case jacked back in. \"Figured that was Winter-\nmute requestin' the pleasure....\"\n\"Yeah.

Got some snags, but we're working on it.\"\n\"You wanna tell me, maybe?\"\n\"Don't have time.\"\n\"Well, boy, never mind me, I'm just dead anyway.\"\n\"Fuck off,\" Case said, and flipped, cutting off the torn-\nfingernail edge of the Flatline's laughter.", "\"She dreamed of a state involving very little in the way of\nindividual consciousness,\" 3Jane was saying. She cupped a\nlarge cameo in her hand, extending it toward Molly. The carved\nprofile was very much like her own. \"Animal bliss. I think she\nviewed the evolution of the forebrain as a sort of sidestep.\"\nShe withdrew the brooch and studied it, tilting it to catch the\nlight at different angles. \"Only in certain heightened modes\nwould an individual--a clan member--suffer the more pain-\nful aspects of self-awareness. . .\"\nMolly nodded. Case remembered the injection. What had\nthey given her? The pain was still there, but it came through\nas a tight focus of scrambled impressions. Neon worms writhing\nin her thigh, the touch of burlap, smell of frying krill--his\nmind recoiled from it. If he avoided focusing on it, the impres-\nsions overlapped, became a sensory equivalent of white noise.\nIf it could do that to her nervous system, what would her frame\nof mind be?\nHer vision was abnormally clear and bright, even sharper\nthan usual. Things seemed to vibrate, each person or object\ntuned to a minutely different frequency. Her hands, still locked\nin the black ball, were on her lap. She sat in one of the pool\nchairs, her broken leg propped straight in front of her on a\ncamelskin hassock. 3Jane sat opposite, on another hassock,\nhuddled in an oversized djellaba of unbleached wool. She was\nvery young.\n\"Where'd he go?\" Molly asked. \"To take his shot?\"\n3Jane shrugged beneath the folds of the pale heavy robe and\ntossed a strand of dark hair away from her eyes. \"He told me\nwhen to let you in,\" she said. \"He wouldn't tell me why.\nEverything has to be a mystery. Would you have hurt us?\"\nCase felt Molly hesitate. \"I would've killed him. I'd've tried\nto kill the ninja. Then I was supposed to talk with you.\"\n\"Why?\" 3Jane asked, tucking the cameo back into one of\nthe djellaba's inner pockets. \"And why? And what about?\"\nMolly seemed to be studying the high, delicate bones, the\nwide mouth, the narrow hawk nose. 3Jane's eyes were dark,\ncuriously opaque. \"Because I hate him,\" she said at last, \"and\nthe why of that's just the way I'm wired, what he is and what\nI am.\"\n\"And the show,\" 3Jane said. \"I saw the show.\"\nMolly nodded.\n\"But Hideo?\"\n\"Because they're the best. Because one of them killed a\npartner of mine, once.\"\n3Jane became very grave. She raised her eyebrows.\n\"Because I had to see,\" Molly said.\n\"And then we would have talked, you and I? Like this?\"\nHer dark hair was very straight, center-parted, drawn back into\na knot of dull sterling. \"Shall we talk now?\"\n\"Take this off,\" Molly said, raising her captive hands.\n\"You killed my father,\" 3Jane said, no change whatever in\nher tone. \"I was watching on the monitors. My mother's eyes,\nhe called them.\"\n\"He killed the puppet. It looked like you.\"\n\"He was fond of broad gestures,\" she said, and then Riviera\nwas beside her, radiant with drugs, in the seersucker convict\noutfit he'd worn in the roof garden of their hotel.\n\"Getting acquainted? She's an interesting girl, isn't she? I\nthought so when I first saw her.\" He stepped past 3Jane. \"It\nisn't going to work, you know.\"\n\"Isn't it, Peter?\" Molly managed a grin.\n\"Wintermute won't be the first to have made the same mis-\ntake. Underestimating me.\" He crossed the tiled pool border\nto a white enamel table and splashed mineral water into a heavy\ncrystal highball glass. \"He talked with me, Molly. I suppose\nhe talked to all of us. You, and Case, whatever there is of\nArmitage to talk to. He can't really understand us, you know.\nHe has his profiles, but those are only statistics. You may be\nthe statistical animal, darling, and Case is nothing but, but I\npossess a quality unquantifiable by its very nature.\" He drank.\n\"And what exactly is that, Peter?\" Molly asked, her voice\nflat.\nRiviera beamed. \"Perversity.\" He walked back to the two\nwomen, swirling the water that remained in the dense, deeply\ncarved cylinder of rock crystal, as though he enjoyed the weight\nof the thing. \"An enjoyment of the gratuitous act. And I have\nmade a decision, Molly, a wholly gratuitous decision.\"\nShe waited, looking up at him.\n\"Oh, Peter,\" 3Jane said, with the sort of gentle exasperation\nordinarily reserved for children.\n\"No word for you, Molly. He told me about that you see.\n3Jane knows the code, of course, but you won't have it. Neither\nwill Wintermute. My Jane's an ambitious girl, in her perverse\nway.\" He smiled again. \"She has designs on the family empire,\nand a pair of insane artificial intelligences, kinky as the concept\nmay be, would only get in our way. So. Comes her Riviera to\nhelp her out, you see. And Peter says, sit tight. Play Daddy's\nfavorite swing records and let Peter call you up a band to match,\na floor of dancers, a wake for dead King Ashpool.\" He drank\noff the last of the mineral water. \"No, you wouldn't do, Daddy,\nyou would not do. Now that Peter's come home.\" And then,\nhis face pink with the pleasure of cocaine and meperidine, he\nswung the glass hard into her left lens implant, smashing vision\ninto blood and light.", "Maelcum was prone against the cabin ceiling when Case\nremoved the trodes. A nylon sling around his waist was fastened\nto the panels on either side with shock cords and gray rubber\nsuction pads. He had his shirt off and was working on a central\npanel with a clumsy-looking zero-g wrench, the thing's fat\ncountersprings twanging as he removed another hexhead. Mar-\ncus Garvey was groaning and ticking with g-stress.\n\"The Mute takin' I an' I dock,\" the Zionite said, popping\nthe hexhead into a mesh pouch at his waist. \"Maelcum pilot\nth' landin', meantime need we tool f' th' job.\"\n\"You keep tools back there?\" Case craned his neck and\nwatched cords of muscle bunching in the brown back.\n\"This one,\" Maelcum said, sliding a long bundle wrapped\nin black poly from the space behind the panel. He replaced the\npanel, along with a single hexhead to hold it in place. The\nblack package had drifted aft before he'd finished. He thumbed\nopen the vacuum valves on the workbelt's gray pads and freed\nhimself, retrieving the thing he'd removed.\nHe kicked back, gliding over his instruments--a green\ndocking diagram pulsed on his central screen--and snagged\nthe frame of Case's g-web. He pulled himself down and picked\nat the tape of his package with a thick, chipped thumbnail.\n\"Some man in China say th' truth comes out this,\" he said,\nunwrapping an ancient, oilslick Remington automatic shotgun,\nits barrel chopped off a few millimeters in front of the battered\nforestock. The shoulderstock had been removed entirely, re-\nplaced with a wooden pistolgrip wound with dull black tape.\nHe smelled of sweat and ganja.\n\"That the only one you got?\"\n\"Sure, mon,\" he said, wiping oil from the black barrel with\na red cloth, the black poly wrapping bunched around the pis-\ntolgrip in his other hand, \"I an' I th' Rastafarian navy, believe\nit.\"\nCase pulled the trodes down across his forehead. He'd never\nbothered to put the Texas catheter back on; at least he could\ntake a real piss in the Villa Straylight, even if it was his last.\nHe jacked in.", "\"Hey,\" the construct said, \"ol' Peter's totally apeshit, huh?\"\nThey seemed to be part of the Tessier-Ashpool ice now; the\nemerald arches had widened, grown together, become a solid\nmass. Green predominated in the planes of the Chinese program\nthat surrounded them. \"Gettin' close, Dixie?\"\n\"Real close. Need you soon.\"\n\"Listen, Dix. Wintermute says Kuang's set itself up solid\nin our Hosaka. I'm going to have to jack you and my deck out\nof the Circuit, haul you into Straylight, and plug you back in,\ninto the custodial program there, Wintermute says.

She was unconscious, and he was barred\nfrom her dreams. When the optic chip flared, the alphanumerics\nwere haloed, each one ringed with a faint pink aura.\n07:29:40.\n\"I'm very unhappy with this, Peter.\" 3Jane's voice seemed\nto arrive from a hollow distance. Molly could hear, he realized,\nthen corrected himself. The simstim unit was intact and still\nin place; he could feel it digging against her ribs.

Hideo will bring a medical unit down from intensive care,\nbut this needs a surgeon.\"\nThere was a silence. Very distinctly, Case heard the water\nlap against the side of the pool.\n\"What was that you were telling her, when I came back?\"\nRiviera was very close now.\n\"About my mother. She asked me to. I think she was in\nshock, aside from Hideo's injection. Why did you do that to\nher?\"\n\"I wanted to see if they would break.\"\n\"One did.

I don't think you quite\nunderstand about Hideo. She does, evidently.\"\n\"Like a drink?\"\n\"Wine. The white.\"\nCase jacked out.", "Maelcum was hunched over Garvey's controls, tapping out\ncommands for a docking sequence. The module's central screen\ndisplayed a fixed red square that represented the Straylight\ndock. Garvey was a larger square, green, that shrank slowly,\nwavering from side to side with Maelcum's commands. To the\nleft, a smaller screen displayed a skeletal graphic of Garvey\nand Haniwa as they approached the curvature of the spindle.\n\"We got an hour, man,\" Case said, pulling the ribbon of\nfiberoptics from the Hosaka. His deck's back-up batteries were\ngood for ninety minutes, but the Flatline's construct would be\nan additional drain. He worked quickly, mechanically, fasten-\ning the construct to the bottom of the Ono-Sendai with micro-\npore tape. Maelcum's workbelt drifted past. He snagged it,\nunclipped the two lengths of shock cord, with their gray rec-\ntangular suction pads, and hooked the jaws of one clip through\nthe other. He held the pads against the sides of his deck and\nworked the thumb lever that created suction. With the deck,\nconstruct, and improvised shoulder strap suspended in front of\nhim, he struggled into his leather jacket, checking the contents\nof his pockets. The passport Armitage had given him, the bank\nchip in the same name, the credit chip he'd been issued when\nhe'd entered Freeside, two derms of the betaphenethylamine\nhe'd bought from Bruce, a roll of New Yen, half a pack of\nYeheyuans, and the shuriken. He tossed the Freeside chip over\nhis shoulders, heard it click off the Russian scrubber. He was\nabout to do the same with the steel star, but the rebounding\ncredit chip clipped the back of his skull, spun off, struck the\nceiling, and tumbled past Maelcum's left shoulder. The Zionite\ninterrupted his piloting to glare back at him. Case looked at\nthe shuriken, then tucked it into his jacket pocket, hearing the\nlining tear.\n\"You missin' th' Mute, mon,\" Maelcum said. \"Mute say\nhe messin' th' security for Garvey. Garvey dockin' as 'nother\nboat, boat they 'spectin' out of Babylon. Mute broadcastin'\ncodes for us.\"\n\"We gonna wear the suits?\"\n\"Too heavy.\" Maelcum shrugged. \"Stay in web 'til I tell\nyou.\" He tapped a final sequence into the module and grabbed\nthe worn pink handholds on either side of the navigation board.\nCase saw the green square shrink a final few millimeters to\noverlap the red square. On the smaller screen, Haniwa lowered\nher bow to miss the curve of the spindle and was snared. Garvey\nwas still slung beneath her like a captive grub. The tug rang,\nshuddered. Two stylized arms sprang out to grip the slender\nwasp shape. Straylight extruded a tentative yellow rectangle\nthat curved, groping past Haniwa for Garvey.\nThere was a scraping sound from the bow, beyond the trem-\nbling fronds of caulk.\n\"Mon,\" Maelcum said, \"mind we got gravity.\" A dozen\nsmall objects struck the floor of the cabin simultaneously, as\nthough drawn there by a magnet. Case gasped as his internal\norgans were pulled into a different configuration. The deck and\nconstruct had fallen painfully to his lap.\nThey were attached to the spindle now, rotating with it.\nMaelcum spread his arms, flexed tension from his shoulders,\nand removed his purple dreadbag, shaking out his locks. \"Come\nnow, mon, if you seh time be mos' precious.\""], "19": ["The Villa Straylight was a parasitic structure, Case reminded\nhimself, as he stepped past the tendrils of caulk and through\nMarcus Garvey's forward hatch. Straylight bled air and water\nout of Freeside, and had no ecosystem of its own.\nThe gangway tube the dock had extended was a more elab-\norate version of the one he'd tumbled through to reach Haniwa,\ndesigned for use in the spindle's rotation gravity. A corrugated\ntunnel, articulated by integral hydraulic members, each seg-\nment ringed with a loop of tough, nonslip plastic, the loops\nserving as the rungs of a ladder. The gangway had snaked its\nway around Haniwa; it was horizontal , where it joined Garvey' s\nlock, but curved up sharply and to the left, a vertical climb\naround the curvature of the yacht's hull. Maelcum was already\nmaking his way up the rings, pulling himself up with his left\nhand, the Remington in his right. He wore a stained pair of\nbaggy fatigues, his sleeveless green nylon jacket, and a pair\nof ragged canvas sneakers with bright red soles. The gangway\nshifted slightly, each time he climbed to another ring.\nThe clips on Case's makeshift strap dug into his shoulder\nwith the weight of the Ono-Sendai and the Flatline's construct.\nAll he felt now was fear, a generalized dread. He pushed it\naway, forcing himself to replay Armitage's lecture on the spin-\ndle and Villa Straylight. He started climbing. Freeside's eco-\nsystem was limited, not closed. Zion was a closed system,\ncapable of cycling for years without the introduction of external\nmaterials. Freeside produced its own air and water, but relied\non constant shipments of food, on the regular augmentation\nof soil nutrients. The Villa Straylight produced nothing at all.\n\"Mon,\" Maelcum said quietly, \"get up here, 'side me.\" Case\nedged sideways on the circular ladder and climbed the last few\nrungs. The gangway ended in a smooth, slightly convex hatch,\ntwo meters in diameter. The hydraulic members of the tube\nvanished into flexible housings set into the frame of the hatch.\n\"So what do we--\"\nCase's mouth shut as the hatch swung up, a slight differential\nin pressure puffing fine grit into his eyes.\nMaelcum scrambled up, over the edge, and Case heard the\ntiny click of the Remington's safety being released. \"You th'\nmon in th' hurry....\" Maelcum whispered, crouching there.\nThen Case was beside him.\nThe hatch was centered in a round, vaulted chamber floored\nwith blue nonslip plastic tiles. Maelcum nudged him, pointed,\nand he saw a monitor set into a curved wall. On the screen, a\ntall young man with the Tessier-Ashpool features was brushing\nsomething from the sleeves of his dark suitcoat. He stood beside\nan identical hatch, in an identical chamber. \"Very sorry, sir,\"\nsaid a voice from a grid centered above the hatch. Case glanced\nup. \"Expected you later, at the axial dock. One moment, please.\"\nOn the monitor, the young man tossed his head impatiently.\nMaelcum spun as a door slid open to their left, the shotgun\nready. A small Eurasian in orange coveralls stepped through\nand goggled at them. He opened his mouth, but nothing came\nout. He closed his mouth. Case glanced at the monitor. Blank.\n\"Who?\" the man managed.\n\"The Rastafarian navy,\" Case said, standing up, the cyber-\nspace deck banging against his hip, \"and all we want's a jack\ninto your custodial system.\"\nThe man swallowed. \"Is this a test? It's a loyalty check. It\nmust be a loyalty check.\" He wiped the palms of his hands on\nthe thighs of his orange suit.\n\"No, mon, this a real one.\" Maelcum came up out of his\ncrouch with the Remington pointed at the Eurasian's face. \"You\nmove it.\"\nThey followed the man back through the door, into a corridor\nwhose polished concrete walls and irregular floor of overlap-\nping carpets were perfectly familiar to Case. \"Pretty rugs,\"\nMaelcum said, prodding the man in the back. \"Smell like\nchurch.\"\nThey came to another monitor, an antique Sony, this one\nmounted above a console with a keyboard and a complex array\nof jack panels. The screen lit as they halted, the Finn grinning\ntensely out at them from what seemed to be the front room of\nMetro Holografix. \"Okay,\" he said, \"Maelcum takes this guy\ndown the corridor to the open locker door, sticks him in there,\nI'll lock it. Case, you want the fifth socket from the left, top\npanel. There's adaptor plugs in the cabinet under the console.\nNeeds Ono-Sendai twenty-point into Hitachi forty.\" As Mael-\ncum nudged his captive along, Case knelt and fumbled through\nan assortment of plugs, finally coming up with the one he\nneeded. With his deck jacked into the adaptor, he paused.\n\"Do you have to look like that, man?\" he asked the face on\nthe screen. The Finn was erased a line at a time by the image\nof Lonny Zone against a wall of peeling Japanese posters.\n\"Anything you want, baby,\" Zone drawled, \"just hop it for\nLonny....\"\n\"No,\" Case said, \"use the Finn.\" As the Zone image van-\nished, he shoved the Hitachi adaptor into its socket and settled\nthe trodes across his forehead.", "\"What kept you?\" the Flatline asked, and laughed.\n\"Told you don't do that,\" Case said.\n\"Joke, boy,\" the construct said, \"zero time lapse for me.\nLemme see what we got here....\"\nThe Kuang program was green, exactly the shade of the\nT-A ice. Even as Case watched, it grew gradually more opaque,\nalthough he could see the black-mirrored shark thing clearly\nwhen he looked up. The fracture lines and hallucinations were\ngone now, and the thing looked real as Marcus Garvey, a\nwingless antique jet, its smooth skin plated with black chrome.\n\"Right on,\" the Flatline said.\n\"Right,\" Case said, and flipped.", "\"--like that. I'm sorry,\" 3Jane was saying, as she bandaged\nMolly's head. \"Our unit says no concussion, no permanent\ndamage to the eye. You didn't know him very well, before\nyou came here?\"\n\"Didn't know him at all,\" Molly said bleakly. She was on\nher back on a high bed or padded table. Case couldn't feel the\ninjured leg. The synaesthetic effect of the original injection\nseemed to have worn off. The black ball was gone, but her\nhands were immobilized by soft straps she couldn't see.\n\"He wants to kill you.\"\n\"Figures,\" Molly said, staring up at the rough ceiling past\na very bright light.\n\"I don't think I want him to,\" 3Jane said, and Molly pain-\nfully turned her head to look up into the dark eyes.\n\"Don't play with me,\" she said.\n\"But I think I might like to,\" 3Jane said, and bent to kiss\nher forehead, brushing the hair back with a warm hand. There\nwere smears of blood on her pale djellaba.\n\"Where's he gone now?\" Molly asked.\n\"Another injection, probably,\" 3Jane said, straightening up.\n\"He was quite impatient for your arrival. I think it might be\nfun to nurse you back to health, Molly.\" She smiled, absently\nwiping a bloody hand down the front of the robe. \"Your leg\nwill need to be reset, but we can arrange that.\"\n\"What about Peter?\"\n\"Peter.\" She gave her head a little shake. A strand of dark\nhair came loose, fell across her forehead. \"Peter has become\nrather boring. I find drug use in general to be boring.\" She\ngiggled. \"In others, at any rate. My father was a dedicated\nabuser, as you must have seen.\"\nMolly tensed.\n\"Don't alarm yourself.\" 3Jane's fingers brushed the skin\nabove the waistband of the leather jeans. \"His suicide was the\nresult of my having manipulated the safety margins of his\nfreeze. I'd never actually met him, you know. I was decanted\nafter he last went down to sleep. But I did know him very well.\nThe cores know everything. I watched him kill my mother. I'll\nshow you that, when you're better. He strangles her in bed.\"\n\"Why did he kill her?\" Her unbandaged eye focused on the\ngirl's face.\n\"He couldn't accept the direction she intended for our fam-\nily. She commissioned the construction of our artificial intel-\nligences. She was quite a visionary. She imagined us in a\nsymbiotic relationship with the Al's, our corporate decisions\nmade for us. Our conscious decisions, I should say. Tessier-\nAshpool would be immortal, a hive, each of us units of a larger\nentity . Fascinating . I'll play her tapes for you, nearly a thousand\nhours. But I've never understood her, really, and with her\ndeath, her direction was lost. All direction was lost, and we\nbegan to burrow into ourselves. Now we seldom come out.\nI'm the exception there.\"\n\"You said you were trying to kill the old man? You fiddled\nhis cryogenic programs?\"\n3Jane nodded. \"I had help. From a ghost. That was what I\nthought when I was very young, that there were ghosts in the\ncorporate cores. Voices. One of them was what you call Win-\ntermute, which is the Turing code for our Berne Al, although\nthe entity manipulating you is a sort of subprogram.\"\n\"One of them? There's more?\"\n\"One other. But that one hasn't spoken to me in years. It\ngave up, I think. I suspect that both represent the fruition of\ncertain capacities my mother ordered designed into the original\nsoftware, but she was an extremely secretive woman when she\nfelt it necessary. Here. Drink.\" She put a flexible plastic tube\nto Molly's lips. \"Water. Only a little.\"\n\"Jane, love,\" Riviera asked cheerfully, from somewhere out\nof sight, \"are you enjoying yourself?\"\n\"Leave us alone, Peter.\"\n\"Playing doctor....\" Suddenly Molly stared into her own\nface, the image suspended ten centimeters from her nose. There\nwere no bandages. The left implant was shattered, a long finger\nof silvered plastic driven deep in a socket that was an inverted\npool of blood.\n\"Hideo,\" 3Jane said, stroking Molly's stomach, \"hurt Peter\nif he doesn't go away. Go and swim, Peter.\"\nThe projection vanished.\n07:58:40, in the darkness of the bandaged eye.\n\"He said you know the code. Peter said. Wintermute needs\nthe code.\" Case was suddenly aware of the Chubb key that lay\non its nylon thong, against the inner curve of her left breast.\n\"Yes,\" 3Jane said, withdrawing her hand, \"I do. I learned\nit as a child. I think I learned it in a dream.... Or somewhere\nin the thousand hours of my mother's diaries. But I think that\nPeter has a point, in urging me not to surrender it. There would\nbe Turing to contend with, if I read all this correctly, and ghosts\nare nothing if not capricious.\"\nCase jacked out.", "\"Strange little customer, huh?\" The Finn grinned at Case\nfrom the old Sony.\nCase shrugged. He saw Maelcum coming back along the\ncorridor with the Remington at his side. The Zionite was smil-\ning, his head bobbing to a rhythm Case couldn't hear. A pair\nof thin yellow leads ran from his ears to a side pocket in his\nsleeveless jacket.\n\"Dub, mon,\" Maelcum said.\n\"You're fucking crazy,\" Case told him.\n\"Hear okay, mon. Righteous dub.\"\n\"Hey, guys,\" the Finn said, \"on your toes. Here comes your\ntransportation. I can't finesse many numbers as smooth as the\npic of 8Jean that conned your doorman, but I can get you a\nride over to 3Jane's place.\"\nCase was pulling the adaptor from its socket when the rid-\nerless service cart swiveled into sight, under the graceless con-\ncrete arch marking the far end of their corridor. It might have\nbeen the one his Africans had ridden, but if it was, they were\ngone now. Just behind the back of the low padded seat, its tiny\nmanipulators gripping the upholstery, the little Braun was\nsteadily winking its red LED.\n\"Bus to catch,\" Case said to Maelcum."], "20": ["He'd lost his anger again. He missed it.\nThe little cart was crowded: Maelcum, the Remington across\nhis knees, and Case, deck and construct against his chest. The\ncart was operating at speeds it hadn't been designed for; it was\ntop heavy, cornering, and Maelcum had taken to leaning out\nin the direction of the turns. This presented no problem when\nthe thing took lefts, because Case sat on the right, but in the\nright turns the Zionite had to lean across Case and his gear,\ncrushing him against the seat.\nHe had no idea where they were. Everything was familiar,\nbut he couldn't be sure he'd seen any particular stretch before.\nA curving hallway lined with wooden showcases displayed\ncollections he was certain he'd never seen: the skulls of large\nbirds, coins, masks of beaten silver. The service cart's six tires\nwere silent on the layered carpets. There was only the whine\nof the electric motor and an occasional faint burst of Zion dub,\nfrom the foam beads in Maelcum's ears, as he lunged past Case\nto counter a sharp right. The deck and the construct kept press-\ning the shuriken in his jacket pocket into his hip.\n\"You got a watch?\" he asked Maelcum.\nThe Zionite shook his locks. \"Time be time.\"\n\"Jesus,\" Case said, and closed his eyes.", "The Braun scuttled over mounded carpets and tapped one\nof its padded claws against an oversized rectangular door of\ndark battered wood. Behind them, the cart sizzled and shot\nblue sparks from a louvered panel. The sparks struck the carpet\nbeneath the cart and Case smelled scorched wool.\n\"This th' way, mon?\" Maelcum eyed the door and snapped\nthe shotgun's safety.\n\"Hey,\" Case said, more to himself than to Maelcum, \"you\nthink I know?\" The Braun rotated its spherical body and the\nLED strobed.\n\"It wan' you open door,\" Maelcum said, nodding.\nCase stepped forward and tried the ornate brass knob. There\nwas a brass plate mounted on the door at eye level, so old that\nthe lettering that had once been engraved there had been re-\nduced to a spidery, unreadable code, the name of some long\ndead function or functionary, polished into oblivion. He won-\ndered vaguely if Tessier-Ashpool had selected each piece of\nStraylight individually, or if they'd purchased it in bulk from\nsome vast European equivalent of Metro Holografix. The door's\nhinges creaked plaintively as he edged it open, Maelcum step-\nping past him with the Remington thrust forward from his hip.\n\"Books,\" Maelcum said.\nThe library, the white steel shelves with their labels.\n\"I know where we are,\" Case said. He looked back at the\nservice cart. A curl of smoke was rising from the carpet. \"So\ncome on,\" he said. \"Cart. Cart?\" It remained stationary. The\nBraun was plucking at the leg of his jeans, nipping at his ankle.\nHe resisted a strong urge to kick it. \"Yeah?\"\nIt ticked its way around the door. He followed it.\nThe monitor in the library was another Sony, as old as the\nfirst one. The Braun paused beneath it and executed a sort of\nJig.\n\"Wintermute?\"\nThe familiar features filled the screen. The Finn smiled.\n\"Time to check in, Case,\" the Finn said, his eyes screwed\nup against the smoke of a cigarette. \"C'mon, jack.\"\nThe Braun threw itself against his ankle and began to climb\nhis leg, its manipulators pinching his flesh through the thin\nblack cloth. \"Shit!\" He slapped it aside and it struck the wall.\nTwo of its limbs began to piston repeatedly, uselessly, pumping\nthe air. \"What's wrong with the goddam thing?\"\n\"Burned out,\" the Finn said. \"Forget it. No problem. lack\nin now.\"\nThere were four sockets beneath the screen, but only one\nwould accept the Hitachi adaptor.\nHe jacked in.", "Nothing. Gray void.\nNo matrix, no grid. No cyberspace.\nThe deck was gone. His fingers were. . .\nAnd on the far rim of consciousness, a scurrying, a fleeting\nimpression of something rushing toward him, across leagues\nof black mirror.\nHe tried to scream.", "There seemed to be a city, beyond the curve of beach, but\nit was far away.\nHe crouched on his haunches on the damp sand, his arms\nwrapped tight across his knees, and shook.\nHe stayed that way for what seemed a very long time, even\nafter the shaking stopped. The city, if it was a city, was low\nand gray. At times it was obscured by banks of mist that came\nrolling in over the lapping surf. At one point he decided that\nit wasn't a city at all, but some single building, perhaps a ruin;\nhe had no way of judging its distance. The sand was the shade\nof tarnished silver that hadn't gone entirely black. The beach\nwas made of sand, the beach was very long, the sand was\ndamp, the bottoms of his jeans were wet from the sand.... He\nheld himself and rocked, singing a song without words or tune.\nThe sky was a different silver. Chiba. Like the Chiba sky.\nTokyo Bay? He turned his head and stared out to sea, longing\nfor the hologram logo of Fuji Electric, for the drone of a\nhelicopter, anything at all.\nBehind him, a gull cried. He shivered.\nA wind was rising. Sand stung his cheek. He put his face\nagainst his knees and wept, the sound of his sobbing as distant\nand alien as the cry of the searching gull. Hot urine soaked his\njeans, dribbled on the sand, and quickly cooled in the wind off\nthe water. When his tears were gone, his throat ached.\n\"Wintermute,\" he mumbled to his knees, \"Wintermute. . .\"\nIt was growing dark, now, and when he shivered, it was\nwith a cold that finally forced him to stand.\nHis knees and elbows ached. His nose was running; he wiped\nit on the cuff of his jacket, then searched one empty pocket\nafter another. \"Jesus,\" he said, shoulders hunched, tucking his\nfingers beneath his arms for warmth. \"Jesus.\" His teeth began\nto chatter.\nThe tide had left the beach combed with patterns more subtle\nthan any a Tokyo gardener produced. When he'd taken a dozen\nsteps in the direction of the now invisible city, he turned and\nlooked back through the gathering dark. His footprints stretched\nto the point of his arrival. There were no other marks to disturb\nthe tarnished sand.\nHe estimated that he'd covered at least a kilometer before\nhe noticed the light. He was talking with Ratz, and it was Ratz\nwho first pointed it out, an orange-red glow to his right, away\nfrom the surf. He knew that Ratz wasn't there, that the bartender\nwas a figment of his own imagination, not of the thing he was\ntrapped in, but that didn't matter. He'd called the man up for\ncomfort of some kind, but Ratz had had his own ideas about\nCase and his predicament.\n\"Really, my artiste, you amaze me. The lengths you will\ngo to in order to accomplish your own destruction. The re-\ndundancy of it! In Night City, you had it, in the palm of your\nhand! The speed to eat your sense away, drink to keep it all\nso fluid, Linda for a sweeter sorrow, and the street to hold the\naxe. How far you've come, to do it now, and what grotesque\nprops.... Playgrounds hung in space, castles hermetically sealed,\nthe rarest rots of old Europa, dead men sealed in little boxes\nmagic out of China....\" Ratz laughed, trudging along beside\nhim, his pink manipulator swinging jauntily at his side. In spite\nof the dark, Case could see the baroque steel that laced the\nbartender's blackened teeth. \"But I suppose that is the way of\nan artiste, no? You needed this world built for you, this beach,\nthis place. To die.\"\nCase halted, swayed, turned toward the sound of surf and\nthe sting of blown sand. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"Shit. I guess. . .\"\nHe walked toward the sound.\n\"Artiste,\" he heard Ratz call. \"The light. You saw a light.\nHere. This way. . .\"\nHe stopped again, staggered, fell to his knees in a few\nmillimeters of icy seawater. \"Ratz? Light? Ratz. . .\"\nBut the dark was total, now, and there was only the sound\nof the surf. He struggled to his feet and tried to retrace his\nsteps.\nTime passed. He walked on.\nAnd then it was there, a glow, defining itself with his every\nstep. A rectangle. A door.\n\"Fire in there,\" he said, his words torn away by the wind.\nIt was a bunker, stone or concrete, buried in drifts of the\ndark sand. The doorway was low, narrow, doorless, and deep,\nset into a wall at least a meter thick. \"Hey,\" Case said, softly,\n\"hey. . .\" His fingers brushed the cold wall. There was a fire,\nin there, shifting shadows on the sides of the entrance.\nHe ducked low and was through, inside, in three steps.\nA girl was crouched beside rusted steel, a sort of fireplace,\nwhere driftwood burned, the wind sucking smoke up a dented\nchimney. The fire was the only light, and as his gaze met the\nwide, startled eyes, he recognized her headband, a rolled scarf,\nprinted with a pattern like magnified circuitry.", "He refused her arms, that night, refused the food she offered\nhim, the place beside her in the nest of blankets and shredded\nfoam. He crouched beside the door, finally, and watched her\nsleep, listening to the wind scour the structure's walls. Every\nhour or so, he rose and crossed to the makeshift stove, adding\nfresh driftwood from the pile beside it. None of this was real,\nbut cold was cold.\nShe wasn't real, curled there on her side in the firelight. He\nwatched her mouth, the lips parted slightly. She was the girl\nhe remembered from their trip across the Bay, and that was\ncruel.\n\"Mean, motherfucker,\" he whispered to the wind. \"Don't\ntake a chance, do you? Wouldn't give me any junkie, huh? I\nknow what this is....\" He tried to keep the desperation from\nhis voice. \"I know, see? I know who you are. You're the other\none. 3Jane told Molly. Burning bush. That wasn't Wintermute,\nit was you. He tried to warn me off with the Braun. Now you\ngot me flatlined, you got me here. Nowhere. With a ghost.\nLike I remember her before....\"\nShe stirred in her sleep, called something out, drawing a\nscrap of blanket across her shoulder and cheek.\n\"You aren't anything,\" he said to the sleeping girl. \"You're\ndead and you meant fuck-all to me anyway. Hear that, buddy?\nI know what you're doing. I'm flatlined. This has all taken\nabout twenty seconds, right? I'm out on my ass in that library\nand my brain's dead. And pretty soon it'll be dead, if you got\nany sense. You don't want Wintermute to pull his scam off,\nis all, so you can just hang me up here. Dixie'll run Kuang,\nbut his ass is dead and you can second guess his moves, sure.\nThis Linda shit, yeah, that's all been you, hasn't it? Wintermute\ntried to use her when he sucked me into the Chiba construct,\nbut he couldn't. Said it was too tricky. That was you moved\nthe stars around in Freeside, wasn't it? That was you put her\nface on the dead puppet in Ashpool's room. Molly never saw\nthat. You just edited her simstim signal. 'Cause you think you\ncan hurt me. 'Cause you think I gave a shit. Well, fuck you,\nwhatever you're called. You won. You win. But none of it\nmeans anything to me now, right? Think I care? So why'd you\ndo it to me this way?\" He was shaking again, his voice shrill.\n\"Honey,\" she said, twisting up from the rags of blankets,\n\"you come here and sleep. I'll sit up, you want. You gotta\nsleep, okay?\" Her soft accent was exaggerated with sleep. \"You\njust sleep, okay?\"", "When he woke, she was gone. The fire was dead, but it\nwas warm in the bunker, sunlight slanting through the doorway\nto throw a crooked rectangle of gold on the ripped side of a\nfat fiber canister. The thing was a shipping container; he\nremembered them from the Chiba docks. Through the rent in\nits side, he could see half a dozen bright yellow packets. In\nthe sunlight, they looked like giant pats of butter. His stomach\ntightened with hunger. Rolling out of the nest, he went to the\ncanister and fished one of the things out, blinking at small print\nin a dozen languages. The English was on the bottom. EMERG.\nRATION, HI-PRO, \"BEEF\", TYPE AG-8. A listing of nutri-\ntive content. He fumbled a second one out. \"EGGS\". \"If you're\nmaking this shit up,\" he said, \"you could lay on some real\nfood, okay?\" With a packet in either hand, he made his way\nthrough the structure's four rooms. Two were empty, aside\nfrom drifts of sand, and the fourth held three more of the ration\ncanisters. \"Sure,\" he said touching the seals. \"Stay here a long\ntime. I get the idea. Sure. . .\"\nHe searched the room with the fireplace, finding a plastic\ncanister filled with what he assumed was rainwater. Beside the\nnest of blankets, against the wall, lay a cheap red lighter, a\nseaman's knife with a cracked green handle, and her scarf. It\nwas still knotted, and stiff with sweat and dirt. He used the\nknife to open the yellow packets, dumping their contents into\na rusted can that he found beside the stove. He dipped water\nfrom the canister, mixed the resulting mush with his fingers,\nand ate. It tasted vaguely like beef. When it was gone, he\ntossed the can into the fireplace and went out.\nLate afternoon, by the feel of the sun, its angle. He kicked\noff his damp nylon shoes and was startled by the warmth of\nthe sand. In daylight, the beach was silver-gray. The sky was\ncloudless, blue. He rounded the comer of the bunker and walked\ntoward the surf, dropping his jacket on the sand. \"Dunno whose\nmemories you're using for this one,\" he said when he reached\nthe water. He peeled off his jeans and kicked them into the\nshallow surf, following them with t-shirt and underwear.\n\"What you doin', Case?\"\nHe turned and found her ten meters down the beach, the\nwhite foam sliding past her ankles.\n\"I pissed myself last night,\" he said.\n\"Well, you don't wanna wear those. Saltwater. Give you\nsores. I'll show you this pool back in the rocks.\" She gestured\nvaguely behind her. \"It's fresh.\" The faded French fatigues\nhad been hacked away above the knee; the skin below was\nsmooth and brown. A breeze caught at her hair.\n\"Listen,\" he said, scooping his clothes up and walking to-\nward her, \"I got a question for you. I won't ask you what\nyou're doing here. But what exactly do you think I'm doing\nhere?\" He stopped, a wet black jeans-leg slapping against his\nbare thigh.\n\"You came last night,\" she said. She smiled at him.\n\"And that's enough for you? I just came?\"\n\"He said you would,\" she said, wrinkling her nose. She\nshrugged. \"He knows stuff like that, I guess.\" She lifted her\nleft foot and rubbed salt from the other ankle, awkward, child-\nlike. She smiled at him again, more tentatively. \"Now you\nanswer me one, okay?\"\nHe nodded.\n\"How come you're painted brown like that, all except your\nfoot?\"", "\"And that's the last thing you remember?\" He watched her\nscrape the last of the freeze-dried hash from the rectangular\nsteel box cover that was their only plate.\nShe nodded, her eyes huge in the firelight. \"I'm sorry, Case,\nhonest to God. It was just the shit, I guess, an' it was . . .\" She\nhunched forward, forearms across her knees, her face twisted\nfor a few seconds with pain or its memory. \"I just needed the\nmoney. To get home, I guess, or...hell,\" she said, \"you\nwouldn't hardly talk to me.\"\n\"There's no cigarettes?\"\n\"Goddam, Case, you asked me that ten times today! What's\nwrong with you?\" She twisted a strand of hair into her mouth\nand chewed at it.\n\"But the food was here? It was already here?\"\n\"I told you, man, it was washed up on the damn beach.\"\n\"Okay. Sure. It's seamless.\"\nShe started to cry again, a dry sobbing. \"Well, damn you\nanyway, Case,\" she managed, finally, \"I was doin' just fine\nhere by myself.\"\nHe got up, taking his jacket, and ducked through the door-\nway, scraping his wrist on rough concrete. There was no moon,\nno wind, sea sound all around him in the darkness. His jeans\nwere tight and clammy. \"Okay,\" he said to the night, \"I buy\nit. I guess I buy it. But tomorrow some cigarettes better wash\nup.\" His own laughter startled him. \"A case of beer wouldn't\nhurt, while you're at it.\" He turned and re-entered the bunker.\nShe was stirring the embers with a length of silvered wood.\n\"Who was that, Case, up in your coffin in Cheap Hotel? Flash\nsamurai with those silver shades, black leather. Scared me,\nand after, I figured maybe she was your new girl, 'cept she\nlooked like more money than you had....\" She glanced back\nat him. \"I'm real sorry I stole your RAM.\"\n\"Never mind,\" he said. \"Doesn't mean anything. So you\njust took it over to this guy and had him access it for you?\"\n\"Tony,\" she said. \"I'd been seein' him, kinda. He had a\nhabit an' we . . . anyway, yeah, I remember him running it by\non this monitor, and it was this real amazing graphics stuff,\nand I remember wonderin' how you--\"\n\"There wasn't any graphics in there,\" he interrupted.\n\"Sure was. I just couldn't figure how you'd have all those\npictures of when I was little, Case. How my daddy looked,\nbefore he left. Gimme this duck one time, painted wood, and\nyou had a picture of that....\"\n\"Tony see it?\"\n\"I don't remember. Next thing, I was on the beach, real\nearly, sunrise, those birds all yellin' so lonely. Scared 'cause\nI didn't have a shot on me, nothin', an' I knew I'd be gettin'\nsick.... An' I walked an' walked, 'til it was dark, an' found\nthis place, an' next day the food washed in, all tangled in the\ngreen sea stuff like leaves of hard jelly.\" She slid her stick into\nthe embers and left it there. \"Never did get sick,\" she said, as\nembers crawled. \"Missed cigarettes more. How 'bout you,\nCase? You still wired?\" Firelight dancing under her cheek-\nbones, remembered flash of Wizard's Castle and Tank War\nEuropa.\n\"No,\" he said, and then it no longer mattered, what he knew,\ntasting the salt of her mouth where tears had dried. There was\na strength that ran in her, something he'd known in Night City\nand held there, been held by it, held for a while away from\ntime and death, from the relentless Street that hunted them all.\nIt was a place he'd known before; not everyone could take him\nthere, and somehow he always managed to forget it. Something\nhe'd found and lost so many times. It belonged, he knew--\nhe remembered--as she pulled him down, to the meat, the\nflesh the cowboys mocked. It was a vast thing, beyond know-\ning, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite\nintricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever\nread\nThe zipper hung, caught, as he opened the French fatigues,\nthe coils of toothed nylon clotted with salt. He broke it, some\ntiny metal part shooting off against the wall as salt-rotten cloth\ngave, and then he was in her, effecting the transmission of the\nold message. Here, even here, in a place he knew for what it\nwas, a coded model of some stranger's memory, the drive held.\nShe shuddered against him as the stick caught fire, a leaping\nflare that threw their locked shadows across the bunker wall.\nLater, as they lay together, his hand between her thighs, he\nremembered her on the beach, the white foam pulling at her\nankles, and he remembered what she had said.\n\"He told you I was coming,\" he said.\nBut she only rolled against him, buttocks against his thighs,\nand put her hand over his, and muttered something out of\ndream."], "21": ["The music woke him, and at first it might have been the\nbeat of his own heart. He sat up beside her, pulling his jacket\nover his shoulders in the predawn chill, gray light from the\ndoorway and the fire long dead.\nHis vision crawled with ghost hieroglyphs, translucent lines\nof symbols arranging themselves against the neutral backdrop\nof the bunker wall. He looked at the backs of his hands, saw\nfaint neon molecules crawling beneath the skin, ordered by the\nunknowable code. He raised his right hand and moved it ex-\nperimentally. It left a faint, fading trail of strobed afterimages.\nThe hair stood up along his arms and at the back of his\nneck. He crouched there with his teeth bared and felt for the\nmusic. The pulse faded, returned, faded....\n\"What's wrong?\" She sat up, clawing hair from her eyes.\n\"Baby . . .\"\n\"I feel ... like a drug.... You get that here?\"\nShe shook her head, reached for him, her hands on his upper\narms.\n\"Linda, who told you? Who told you I'd come? Who?\"\n\"On the beach,\" she said, something forcing her to look\naway. \"A boy. I see him on the beach. Maybe thirteen. He\nlives here.\"\n\"And what did he say?\"\n\"He said you'd come. He said you wouldn't hate me. He\nsaid we'd be okay here, and he told me where the rain pool\nwas. He looks Mexican.\"\n\"Brazilian,\" Case said, as a new wave of symbols washed\ndown the wall. \"I think he's from Rio.\" He got to his feet and\nbegan to struggle into his jeans.\n\"Case,\" she said, her voice shaking, \"Case, where you\ngoin ' ?\"\n\"I think I'll find that boy,\" he said, as the music came\nsurging back, still only a beat, steady and familiar, although\nhe couldn't place it in memory.\n\"Don't, Case.\"\n\"I thought I saw something, when I got here. A city down\nthe beach. But yesterday it wasn't there. You ever seen that?\"\nHe yanked his zipper up and tore at the impossible knot in his\nshoelaces, finally tossing the shoes into the corner.\nShe nodded, eyes lowered. \"Yeah. I see it sometimes.\"\n\"You ever go there, Linda?\" He put his jacket on.\n\"No,\" she said, \"but I tried. After I first came, an' I was\nbored. Anyway, I figured it's a city, maybe I could find some\nshit.\" She grimaced. \"I wasn't even sick, I just wanted it. So\nI took food in a can, mixed it real wet, because I didn't have\nanother can for water. An' I walked all day, an' I could see\nit, sometimes, city, an' it didn't seem too far. But it never got\nany closer. An' then it was gettin' closer, an' I saw what it\nwas. Sometimes that day it had looked kinda like it was wrecked,\nor maybe nobody there, an' other times I thought I'd see light\nflashin' off a machine, cars or somethin' ....\" Her voice trailed\noff.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"This thing,\" she gestured around at the fireplace, the dark\nwalls, the dawn outlining the doorway, \"where we live. It gets\nsmaller, Case, smaller, closer you get to it.\"\nPausing one last time, by the doorway. \"You ask your boy\nabout that?\"\n\"Yeah. He said I wouldn't understand, an' I was wastin'\nmy time. Said it was, was like . . . an event. An' it was our\nhorizon. Event horizon, he called it.\"\nThe words meant nothing to him. He left the bunker and\nstruck out blindly, heading--he knew, somehow--away from\nthe sea. Now the hieroglyphs sped across the sand, fled from\nhis feet, drew back from him as he walked. \"Hey,\" he said,\n\"it's breaking down. Bet you know, too. What is it? Kuang?\nChinese icebreaker eating a hole in your heart? Maybe the Dixie\nFlatline's no pushover, huh?\"\nHe heard her call his name. Looked back and she was\nfollowing him, not trying to catch up, the broken zip of the\nFrench fatigues flapping against the brown of her belly, pubic\nhair framed in torn fabric. She looked like one of the girls on\nthe Finn's old magazines in Metro Holografix come to life,\nonly she was tired and sad and human, the ripped costume\npathetic as she stumbled over clumps of salt-silver sea grass.\nAnd then, somehow, they stood in the surf, the three of\nthem, and the boy's gums were wide and bright pink against\nhis thin brown face. He wore ragged, colorless shorts, limbs\ntoo thin against the sliding blue-gray of the tide.\n\"I know you,\" Case said, Linda beside him.\n\"No,\" the boy said, his voice high and musical, \"you do\nnot.\"\n\"You're the other AI. You're Rio. You're the one who wants\nto stop Wintermute. What's your name? Your Turing code.\nWhat is it?\"\nThe boy did a handstand in the surf, laughing. He walked\non his hands, then flipped out of the water. His eyes were\nRiviera's, but there was no malice there. \"To call up a demon\nyou must learn its name. Men dreamed that, once, but now it\nis real in another way. You know that, Case. Your business is\nto learn the names of programs, the long formal names, names\nthe owners seek to conceal. True names. . .\"\n\"A Turing code's not your name.\"\n\"Neuromancer,\" the boy said, slitting long gray eyes against\nthe rising sun. \"The lane to the land of the dead. Where you\nare, my friend. Marie-France, my lady, she prepared this road\nbut her lord choked her off before I could read the book of he;\ndays. Neuro from the nerves, the silver paths. Romancer. Nec-\nromancer. I call up the dead. But no, my friend,\" and the boy\ndid a little dance, brown feet printing the sand, \"I am the dead,\nand their land.\" He laughed. A gull cried. \"Stay. If your woman\nis a ghost, she doesn't know it. Neither will you.\"\n\"You're cracking. The ice is breaking up.\"\n\"No,\" he said, suddenly sad, his fragile shoulders sagging.\nHe rubbed his foot against the sand. \"It is more simple than\nthat. But the choice is yours.\" The gray eyes regarded Case\ngravely. A fresh wave of symbols swept across his vision, one\nline at a time. Behind them, the boy wriggled, as though seen\nthrough heat rising from summer asphalt. The music was loud\nnow, and Case could almost make out the lyrics.\n\"Case, honey,\" Linda said, and touched his shoulder.\n\"No,\" he said. He took off his jacket and handed it to her.\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"maybe you're here. Anyway, it gets\ncold.\"\nHe turned and walked away, and after the seventh step, he'd\nclosed his eyes, watching the music define itself at the center\nof things. He did look back, once, although he didn't open his\neyes.\nHe didn't need to.\nThey were there by the edge of the sea, Linda Lee and the\nthin child who said his name was Neuromancer. His leather\njacket dangled from her hand, catching the fringe of the surf.\nHe walked on, following the music.\nMaelcum's Zion dub.", "There was a gray place, an impression of fine screens shift-\ning, moire, degrees of half tone generated by a very simple\ngraphics program. There was a long hold on a view through\nchainlink, gulls frozen above dark water. There were voices.\nThere was a plain of black mirror, that tilted, and he was\nquicksilver, a bead of mercury, skittering down, striking the\nangles of an invisible maze, fragmenting, flowing together,\nsliding again....", "\"Case? Mon?\"\nThe music.\n\"You back, mon.\"\nThe music was taken from his ears.\n\"How long?\" he heard himself ask, and knew that his mouth\nwas very dry.\n\"Five minute, maybe. Too long. I wan' pull th' jack, Mute\nseh no. Screen goin' funny, then Mute seh put th' phones on\nyou.\"\nHe opened his eyes. Maelcum's features were overlayed\nwith bands of translucent hieroglyphs.\n\"An' you medicine,\" Maelcum said. \"Two derm.\"\nHe was flat on his back on the library floor, below the\nmonitor. The Zionite helped him sit up, but the movement\nthrew him into the savage rush of the betaphenethylamine, the\nblue derms burning against his left wrist. \"Overdose,\" he man-\naged.\n\"Come on, mon,\" the strong hands beneath his armpits,\nlifting him like a child, \"I an' I mus' go.\""], "22": ["The service cart was crying. The betaphenethylamine gave\nit a voice. It wouldn't stop. Not in the crowded gallery, the\nlong corridors, not as it passed the black glass entrance to the\nT-A crypt, the vaults where the cold had seeped so gradually\ninto old Ashpool's dreams.\nThe transit was an extended rush for Case, the movement\nof the cart indistinguishable from the insane momentum of the\noverdose. When the cart died, at last, something beneath the\nseat giving up with a shower of white sparks, the crying stopped.\nThe thing coasted to a stop three meters from the start of\n3Jane's pirate cave.\n\"How far, mon?\" Maelcum helped him from the sputtering\ncart as an integral extinguisher exploded in the thing's engine\ncompartment, gouts of yellow powder squirting from louvers\nand service points. The Braun tumbled from the back of the\nseat and hobbled off across the imitation sand, dragging one\nuseless limb behind it. \"You mus' walk, mon.\" Maelcum took\nthe deck and construct, slinging the shock cords over his shoul-\nder.\nThe trodes rattled around Case's neck as he followed the\nZionite. Riviera's holos waited for them, the torture scenes and\nthe cannibal children. Molly had broken the triptych. Maelcum\nignored them.\n\"Easy,\" Case said, forcing himself to catch up with the\nstriding figure. \"Gotta do this right.\"\nMaelcum halted, turned, glowering at him, the Remington\nin his hands. \"Right, mon? How's right?\"\n\"Got Molly in there, but she's out of it. Riviera, he can\nthrow holos. Maybe he's got Molly's fletcher.\" Maelcum nod-\nded. \"And there's a ninja, a family bodyguard.\"\nMaelcum's frown deepened. \"You listen, Babylon mon,\"\nhe said. \"I a warrior. But this no m' fight, no Zion fight.\nBabylon fightin' Babylon, eatin' i'self, ya know? But Jah seh\nI an' I t' bring Steppin' Razor outa this.\"\nCase blinked.\n\"She a warrior,\" Maelcum said, as if it explained everything.\n\"Now you tell me, mon, who I not t' kill.\"\n\"3Jane,\" he said, after a pause. \"A girl there. Has a kinda\nwhite robe thing on, with a hood. We need her.\"", "When they reached the entrance, Maelcum walked straight\nin, and Case had no choice but to follow him.\n3Jane's country was deserted, the pool empty. Maelcum\nhanded him the deck and the construct and walked to the edge\nof the pool. Beyond the white pool furniture, there was dark-\nness, shadows of the ragged, waist-high maze of partially\ndemolished walls.\nThe water lapped patiently against the side of the pool.\n\"They're here,\" Case said. \"They gotta be.\"\nMaelcum nodded.\nThe first arrow pierced his upper arm. The Remington roared,\nits meter of muzzle-flash blue in the light from the pool. The\nsecond arrow struck the shotgun itself, sending it spinning\nacross the white tiles. Maelcum sat down hard and fumbled at\nthe black thing that protruded from his arm. He yanked at it.\nHideo stepped out of the shadows, a third arrow ready in a\nslender bamboo bow. He bowed.\nMaelcum stared, his hand still on the steel shaft.\n\"The artery is intact,\" the ninja said. Case remembered\nMolly's description of the man who-d killed her lover. Hideo\nwas another. Ageless, he radiated a sense of quiet, an utter\ncalm. He wore clean, frayed khaki workpants and soft dark\nshoes that fit his feet like gloves, split at the toes like tabi\nsocks. The bamboo bow was a museum piece, but the black\nalloy quiver that protruded above his left shoulder had the look\nof the best Chiba weapons shops. His brown chest was bare\nand smooth.\n\"You cut my thumb, mon, wi' secon' one,\" Maelcum said.\n\"Coriolis force,\" the ninja said, bowing again. \"Most dif-\nficult, slow-moving projectile in rotational gravity. It was not\nintended.\"\n\"Where's 3Jane?\" Case crossed to stand beside Maelcum.\nHe saw that the tip of the arrow in the ninja's bow was like a\ndouble-edged razor. \"Where's Molly?\"\n\"Hello, Case.\" Riviera came strolling out of the dark behind\nHideo, Molly's fletcher in his hand. \"I would have expected\nArmitage, somehow. Are we hiring help out of that Rasta\ncluster now?\"\n\"Armitage is dead.\"\n\"Armitage never existed, more to the point, but the news\nhardly comes as a shock.\"\n\"Wintermute killed him. He's in orbit around the spindle.\"\nRiviera nodded, his long gray eyes glancing from Case to\nMaelcum and back. \"I think it ends here, for you,\" he said.\n\"Where's Molly?\"\nThe ninja relaxed his pull on the fine, braided string, low-\nering the bow. He crossed the tiles to where the Remington\nlay and picked it up. \"This is without subtlety,\" he said, as if\nto himself. His voice was cool and pleasant. His every move\nwas part of a dance, a dance that never ended, even when his\nbody was still, at rest, but for all the power it suggested, there\nwas also a humility, an open simplicity.\n\"It ends here for her, too,\" Riviera said.\n\"Maybe 3Jane won't go for that, Peter,\" Case said, uncertain\nof the impulse. The derms still raged in his system, the old\nfever starting to grip him, Night City craziness. He remembered\nmoments of grace, dealing out on the edge of things, where\nhe'd found that he could sometimes talk faster than he could\nthink.\nThe gray eyes narrowed. \"Why, Case? Why do you think\nthat?\"\nCase smiled. Riviera didn't know about the simstim rig.\nHe'd missed it in his hurry to find the drugs she carried for\nhim. But how could Hideo have missed it? And Case was\ncertain the ninja would never have let 3Jane treat Molly without\nfirst checking her for kinks and concealed weapons. No, he\ndecided, the ninja knew. So 3Jane would know as well.\n\"Tell me, Case,\" Riviera said, raising the pepperbox muzzle\nof the fletcher.\nSomething creaked, behind him, creaked again. 3Jane pushed\nMolly out of the shadows in an ornate Victorian bathchair, its\ntall, spidery wheels squeaking as they turned. Molly was bun-\ndled deep in a red and black striped blanket, the narrow, caned\nback of the antique chair towering above her. She looked very\nsmall. Broken. A patch of brilliantly white micropore covered\nher damaged lens; the other flashed emptily as her head bobbed\nwith the motion of the chair.\n\"A familiar face,\" 3Jane said, \"I saw you the night of Peter's\nshow. And who is this?\"\n\"Maelcum,\" Case said.\n\"Hideo, remove the arrow and bandage Mr. Malcolm's\nwound.\"\nCase was staring at Molly, at the wan face.\nThe ninja walked to where Maelcum sat, pausing to lay his\nbow and the shotgun well out of reach, and took something\nfrom his pocket. A pair of bolt cutters. \"I must cut the shaft,\"\nhe said. \"It is too near the artery.\" Maelcum nodded. His face\nwas grayish and sheened with sweat.\nCase looked at 3Jane. \"There isn't much time,\" he said.\n\"For whom, exactly?\"\n\"For any of us.\" There was a snap as Hideo cut through the\nmetal shaft of the arrow. Maelcum groaned.\n\"Really,\" Riviera said, \"it won't amuse you to hear this\nfailed con artist make a last desperate pitch. Most distasteful,\n1 can assure you. He'll wind up on his knees, offer to sell you\nhis mother, perform the most boring sexual favors....\"\n3Jane threw back her head and laughed. \"Wouldn't 1, Pe-\nter?\"\n\"The ghosts are gonna mix it tonight, lady,\" Case said.\n\"Wintermute's going up against the other one, Neuromancer.\nFor keeps. You know that?\"\n3Jane raised her eyebrows. \"Peter's suggested something\nlike that, but tell me more.\"\n\"I met Neuromancer. He talked about your mother. I think\nhe's something like a giant ROM construct, for recording per-\nsonality, only it's full RAM. The constructs think they're there,\nlike it's real, but it just goes on forever.\"\n3Jane stepped from behind the bathchair. \"Where? Describe\nthe place, this construct.\"\n\"A beach. Gray sand, like silver that needs polishing. And\na concrete thing, kinda bunker....\" He hesitated. \"It's nothing\nfancy. Just old, falling apart. If you walk far enough, you come\nback to where you started.\"\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"Morocco. When Marie-France was a girl,\nyears before she married Ashpool, she spent a summer alone\non that beach, camping in an abandoned blockhouse. She for-\nmulated the basis of her philosophy there.\"\nHideo straightened, slipping the cutters into his workpants.\nHe held a section of the arrow in either hand. Maelcum had\nhis eyes closed, his hand clapped tight around his bicep. \"I\nwill bandage it,\" Hideo said.\nCase managed to fall before Riviera could level the fletcher\nfor a clear shot. The darts whined past his neck like supersonic\ngnats. He rolled, seeing Hideo pivot through yet another step\nof his dance, the razored point of the arrow reversed in his\nhand, shaft flat along palm and rigid fingers. He flicked it\nunderhand, wrist blurring, into the back of Riviera's hand. The\nfletcher struck the tiles a meter away.\nRiviera screamed. But not in pain. It was a shriek of rage,\nso pure, so refined, that it lacked all humanity.\nTwin tight beams of light, ruby red needles, stabbed from\nthe region of Riviera's sternum.\nThe ninja grunted, reeled back, hands to his eyes, then found\nhis balance.\n\"Peter,\" 3Jane said, \"Peter, what have you done?\"\n\"He's blinded your clone boy,\" Molly said flatly.\nHideo lowered his cupped hands. Frozen on the white tile\nCase saw whisps of steam drift from the ruined eyes.\nRiviera smiled.\nHideo swung into his dance, retracing his steps. When he\nstood above the bow, the arrow, and the Remington, Riviera's\nsmile had faded. He bent--bowing, it seemed to Case--and\nfound the bow and arrow.\n\"You're blind,\" Riviera said, taking a step backward.\n\"Peter,\" 3Jane said, \"don't you know he does it in the dark?\nZen. It's the way he practices.\"\nThe ninja notched his arrow. \"Will you distract me with your\nholograms now?\"\nRiviera was backing away, into the dark beyond the pool.\nHe brushed against a white chair; its feet rattled on the tile.\nHideo's arrow twitched.\nRiviera broke and ran, throwing himself over a low, jagged\nlength of wall. The ninja's face was rapt, suffused with a quiet\necstasy.\nSmiling, he padded off into the shadows beyond the wall,\nhis weapon held ready.\n\"Jane-lady,\" Maelcum whispered, and Case turned, to see\nhim scoop the shotgun from the tiles, blood spattering the white\nceramic. He shook his locks and lay the fat barrel in the crook\nof his wounded arm. \"This take your head off, no Babylon\ndoctor fix it.\"\n3Jane stared at the Remington. Molly freed her arms from\nthe folds of the striped blanket, raising the black sphere that\nencased her hands. \"Off,\" she said, \"get it off.\"\nCase rose from the tiles, shook himself. \"Hideo'll get him,\neven blind?\" he asked 3Jane.\n\"When I was a child,\" she said, \"we loved to blindfold him.\nHe put arrows through the pips in playing cards at ten meters.\"\n\"Peter's good as dead anyway,\" Molly said. \"In another\ntwelve hours, he'll start to freeze up. Won't be able to move,\nhis eyes is all.\"\n\"Why?\" Case turned to her.\n\"I poisoned his shit for him,\" she said. \"Condition's like\nParkinson's disease, sort of.\"\n3Jane nodded. \"Yes. We ran the usual medical scan, before\nhe was admitted.\" She touched the ball in a certain way and\nit sprang away from Molly's hands. \"Selective destruction of\nthe cells of the substantia nigra. Signs of the formation of a\nLewy body. He sweats a great deal, in his sleep.\"\n\"Ali,\" Molly said, ten blades glittering, exposed for an\ninstant. She tugged the blanket away from her legs, revealing\nthe inflated cast. \"It's the meperidine. I had Ali make me up\na custom batch. Speeded up the reaction times with higher\ntemperatures. N-methyl-4-phenyl-1236,\" she sang, like a child\nreciting the steps of a sidewalk game, \"tetra-hydro-pyridene.\"\n\"A hotshot,\" Case said.\n\"Yeah,\" Molly said, \"a real slow hotshot.\"\n\"That's appalling,\" 3Jane said, and giggled.", "It was crowded in the elevator. Case was jammed pelvis to\npelvis with 3Jane, the muzzle of the Remington under her chin.\nShe grinned and ground against him. \"You stop,\" he said,\nfeeling helpless. He had the gun's safety on, but he was terrified\nof injuring her, and she knew it. The elevator was a steel\ncylinder, under a meter in diameter, intended for a single pas-\nsenger. Maelcum had Molly in his arms. She'd bandaged his\nwound, but it obviously hurt him to carry her. Her hip was\npressing the deck and construct into Case's kidneys.\nThey rose out of gravity, toward the axis, the cores.\nThe entrance to the elevator had been concealed beside the\nstairs to the corridor, another touch in 3Jane's pirate cave decor.\n\"I don't suppose I should tell you this,\" 3Jane said, craning\nher head to allow her chin to clear the muzzle of the gun, \"but\nI don't have a key to the room you want. I never have had\none. One of my father's Victorian awkwardnesses. The lock\nis mechanical and extremely complex.\"\n\"Chubb lock,\" Molly said, her voice muffled by Maelcum's\nshoulder, \"and we got the fucking key, no fear.\"\n\"That chip of yours still working?\" Case asked her.\n\"It's eight twenty-five, PM, Greenwich fucking Mean,\" she\nsaid.\n\"We got five minutes,\" Case said, as the door snapped open\nbehind 3Jane. She flipped backward in a slow somersault, the\npale folds of her djellaba billowing around her thighs.\nThey were at the axis, the core of Villa Straylight."], "23": ["Molly fished the key out on its loop of nylon.\n\"You know,\" 3Jane said, craning forward with interest, \"I\nwas under the impression that no duplicate existed. I sent Hideo\nto search my father's things, after you killed him. He couldn't\nfind the original.\"\n\"Wintermute managed to get it stuck in the back of a drawer,\"\nMolly said, carefully inserting the Chubb key's cylindrical shaft\ninto the notched opening in the face of the blank, rectangular\ndoor. \"He killed the little kid who put it there.\" The key rotated\nsmoothly when she tried it.\n\"The head,\" Case said, \"there's a panel in the back of the\nhead. Zircons on it. Get it off. That's where I'm jacking in.\"\nAnd then they were inside.", "\"Christ on a crutch,\" the Flatline drawled, \"you do believe\nin takin' your own good time, don't you, boy?\"\n\"Kuang's ready?\"\n\"Hot to trot.\"\n\"Okay.\" He flipped.", "And found himself staring down, through Molly's one good\neye, at a white-faced, wasted figure, afloat in a loose fetal\ncrouch, a cyberspace deck between its thighs, a band of silver\ntrodes above closed, shadowed eyes. The man's cheeks were\nhollowed with a day's growth of dark beard, his face slick with\nsweat.\nHe was looking at himself.\nMolly had her fletcher in her hand. Her leg throbbed with\neach beat of her pulse, but she could still maneuver in zero-g.\nMaelcum drifted nearby, 3Jane's thin arm gripped in a large\nbrown hand.\nA ribbon of fiberoptics looped gracefully from the Ono-\nSendai to a square opening in the back of the pearl-crusted\nterminal .\nHe tapped the switch again.", "\"Kuang Grade Mark Eleven is haulin' ass in nine seconds,\ncountin', seven, six, five...\"\nThe Flatline punched them up, smooth ascent, the ventral\nsurface of the black chrome shark a microsecond nick of dark-\nness.\n\"Four, three...\"\nCase had the strange impression of being in the pilot's seat\nin a small plane. A flat dark surface in front of him suddenly\nglowed with a perfect reproduction of the keyboard of his deck.\n\"Two, an' kick ass--\"\nHeadlong motion through walls of emerald green, milky\njade, the sensation of speed beyond anything he'd known before\nin cyberspace.... The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling\naway from the Chinese program's thrust, a worrying impression\nof solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent\nand elongated as they fell--", "\"Christ,\" Case said, awestruck, as Kuang twisted and banked\nabove the horizonless fields of the Tessier-Ashpool cores, an\nendless neon cityscape, complexity that cut the eye, jewel bright,\nsharp as razors.\n\"Hey, shit,\" the construct said, \"those things are the RCA\nBuilding. You know the old RCA Building?\" The Kuang pro-\ngram dived past the gleaming spires of a dozen identical towers\nof data, each one a blue neon replica of the Manhattan sky-\nscraper.\n\"You ever see resolution this high?\" Case asked.\n\"No, but I never cracked an Al, either.\"\n\"This thing know where it's going?\"\n\"It better.\"\nThey were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow\nneon.\n\"Dix--\"\nAn arm of shadow was uncoiling from the flickering floor\nbelow, a seething mass of darkness, unformed, shapeless....\n\"Company,\" the Flatline said, as Case hit the representation\nof his deck, fingers flying automatically across the board. The\nKuang swerved sickeningly, then reversed, whipping itself\nbackward, shattering the illusion of a physical vehicle.\nThe shadow thing was growing, spreading, blotting out the\ncity of data. Case took them straight up, above them the dis-\ntanceless bowl of jade-green ice.\nThe city of the cores was gone now, obscured entirely by\nthe dark beneath them.\n\"What is it?\"\n\"An Al's defense system,\" the construct said, \"or part of\nit. If it's your pal Wintermute, he's not lookin' real friendly.\"\n\"Take it,\" Case said. \"You're faster.\"\n\"Now your best de-fense, boy, it's a good off-fense.\"\nAnd the Flatline aligned the nose of Kuang's sting with the\ncenter of the dark below. And dove.\nCase's sensory input warped with their velocity.\nHis mouth filled with an aching taste of blue.\nHis eyes were eggs of unstable crystal, vibrating with a\nfrequency whose name was rain and the sound of trains, sud-\ndenly sprouting a humming forest of hair-fine glass spines. The\nspines split, bisected, split again, exponential growth under the\ndome of the Tessier-Ashpool ice.\nThe roof of his mouth cleaved painlessly, admitting rootlets\nthat whipped around his tongue, hungry for the taste of blue,\nto feed the crystal forests of his eyes, forests that pressed\nagainst the green dome, pressed and were hindered, and spread,\ngrowing down, filling the universe of T-A, down into the wait-\ning, hapless suburbs of the city that was the mind of Tessier-\nAshpool S.A.\nAnd he was remembering an ancient story, a king placing\ncoins on a chessboard, doubling the amount at each square....\nExponential....\nDarkness fell in from every side, a sphere of singing black,\npressure on the extended crystal nerves of the universe of data\nhe had nearly become....\nAnd when he was nothing, compressed at the heart of all\nthat dark, there came a point where the dark could be no more,\nand something tore.\nThe Kuang program spurted from tarnished cloud, Case's\nconsciousness divided like beads of mercury, arcing above an\nendless beach the color of the dark silver clouds. His vision\nwas spherical, as though a single retina lined the inner surface\nof a globe that contained all things, if all things could be\ncounted.\nAnd here things could be counted, each one. He knew the\nnumber of grains of sand in the construct of the beach (a number\ncoded in a mathematical system that existed nowhere outside\nthe mind that was Neuromancer). He knew the number of\nyellow food packets in the canisters in the bunker (four hundred\nand seven). He knew the number of brass teeth in the left half\nof the open zipper of the salt-crusted leather jacket that Linda\nLee wore as she trudged along the sunset beach, swinging a\nstick of driftwood in her hand (two hundred and two).\nHe banked Kuang above the beach and swung the program\nin a wide circle, seeing the black shark thing through her eyes,\na silent ghost hungry against the banks of lowering cloud. She\ncringed, dropping her stick, and ran. He knew the rate of her\npulse, the length of her stride in measurements that would have\nsatisfied the most exacting standards of geophysics.\n\"But you do not know her thoughts,\" the boy said, beside\nhim now in the shark thing's heart. \"I do not know her thoughts.\nYou were wrong, Case. To live here is to live. There is no\ndifference.\"\nLinda in her panic, plunging blind through the surf.\n\"Stop her,\" he said, \"she'll hurt herself.\"\n\"I can't stop her,\" the boy said, his gray eyes mild and\nbeautiful.\n\"You've got Riviera's eyes,\" Case said.\nThere was a flash of white teeth, long pink gums. \"But not\nhis craziness. Because they are beautiful to me.\" He shrugged.\n\"I need no mask to speak with you. Unlike my brother. I create\nmy own personality. Personality is my medium.\"\nCase took them up, a steep climb, away from the beach and\nthe frightened girl. \"Why'd you throw her up to me, you little\nprick? Over and fucking over, and turning me around. You\nkilled her, huh? In Chiba.\"\n\"No,\" the boy said.\n\"Wintermute?\"\n\"No. I saw her death coming. In the patterns you sometimes\nimagined you could detect in the dance of the street. Those\npatterns are real. I am complex enough, in my narrow ways,\nto read those dances. Far better than Wintermute can. I saw\nher death in her need for you, in the magnetic code of the lock\non the door of your coffin in Cheap Hotel, in Julie Deane's\naccount with a Hongkong shirtmaker. As clear to me as the\nshadow of a tumor to a surgeon studying a patient's scan. When\nshe took your Hitachi to her boy, to try to access it--she had\nno idea what it carried, still less how she might sell it, and her\ndeepest wish was that you would pursue and punish her--I\nintervened. My methods are far more subtle than Wintermute's.\nI brought her here. Into myself.\"\n\"Why?\"\n\"Hoping I could bring you here as well, keep you here. But\nI failed.\"\n\"So what now?\" He swung them back into the bank of cloud.\n\"Where do we go from here?\"\n\"I don't know, Case. Tonight the very matrix asks itself\nthat question.

I saw it after Ashpool did the same thing to your\nclone sister.\" Her hands were gentle, almost a caress. 3Jane's\neyes were wide with terror and lust she was shivering with\nfear and longing. Beyond the freefall tangle of 3Jane's hair,\nCase saw his own strained white face, Maelcum behind him,\nbrown hands on the leatherjacketed shoulders, steadying him\nabove the carpet's pattern of woven circuitry.\n\"Would you?\" 3Jane asked, her voice a child's. \"I think\nyou would.\"\n\"The code,\" Molly said. \"Tell the head the code.\"\nJacking out.", "\"She wants it,\" he screamed, \"the bitch wants it!\"\nHe opened his eyes to the cool ruby stare of the terminal,\nits platinum face crusted with pearl and lapis.

When the Kuang\nprogram met the first of the defenders, scattering the leaves of\nlight, he felt the shark thing lose a degree of substantiality, the\nfabric of information loosening.\nAnd then--old alchemy of the brain and its vast phar-\nmacy--his hate flowed into his hands.\nIn the instant before he drove Kuang's sting through the\nbase of the first tower, he attained a level of proficiency ex-\nceeding anything he'd known or imagined. Beyond ego, be-\nyond personality, beyond awareness, he moved, Kuang moving\nwith him, evading his attackers with an ancient dance, Hideo's\ndance, grace of the mind-body interface granted him, in that\nsecond, by the clarity and singleness of his wish to die.\nAnd one step in that dance was the lightest touch on the\nswitch, barely enough to flip--", "now\nand his voice the cry of a birdunknown,\n3Jane answering in song, three\nnotes, high and pure.\nA true name.", "Neon forest, rain sizzling across hot pavement.
